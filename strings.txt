1: For three nights, each attempt to sleep has brought you starting from your bed in fright, with no memory of what horrified you so.
2: With a sickening sense of deja vu, you begin to dream.
3: You try to wake, but tonight the ghostly eyes captivate you.
4: ``Treachery and doom!''
5: ``My brother would unleash a great evil upon us.''
6: ``Britannia is in peril!''

10: ``I'd suspect my brother sent thee, were he alive.''
11: ``Still, thou shalt draw the hounds from the scent.''

13: ``What hast thou done with our lord's daughter Arial?''
14: ``Dropped her below to an accomplice, I'll wager.''
15: ``Well, he'll nay escape us. And when we bring 'im back, you'll both hang!''
16: Several tense hours later, you are dragged before Baron Almric.
17: Ignoring you, Almric questions his captain.
18: ``What news, Corwin?''
19: ``Forgive us, milord.''
20: ``The foul creature escaped.''
21: ``A score of us gave chase, but it fled into the Stygian Abyss with poor Arial.''
22: ``We were attacked_._._. Goblins and worse, milord.''
23: ``Only three of us survived!''
24: ``I see.''
25: The baron turns his piercing blue eyes upon you.
26: ``I was warned of thy coming.''
27: ``Last fortnight, an apparition of an old, haggard man appeared in my dreams.''
28: ``^`Guard thy daughter well,' it warned. `For an evil one shall come to steal her away.'^''
29: ``I posted guards at Arial's door, but still you took her from me!''
30: ``They say thou didst drop her to a Troll waiting below. What sayest thou?''
31: You explain that you are the Avatar and that you are innocent.
32: ``Whether thou speak truth or falsehood I cannot say.''
33: ``Stories tell of the comings of the Avatar, but years have passed since he visited here.''
34: ``If thou art truly the Avatar, then perhaps thou canst offer hope.''
35: ``None here can survive the Abyss and rescue Arial.''
36: ``My mind is set. Corwin shall take thee to the Abyss.''
37: ``Return here with my daughter, and thy innocence shall be proven.''
38: ``If thou dost not return, `Avatar,' thy lies shall have brought thee low.''
39: ``This be the foul pit's only entrance. Once it is locked, none can pass.''
40: ``I will shut thee in and stand guard until Arial's voice do I hear from within.''

1: Diving into the ocean, you make for a lone boat.
2: You are helped aboard by the guards' captain Corwin! It is the Baron's vessel.
3: ``Thou hast earned my gratitude, and more.''
4: ``Were it not for thee, my daughter tells me we would have lost more than her delightful company.''
5: ``Truly, I was a fool for doubting thee. Canst thou forgive a worried father?''
6: ``Thou art the greatest hero ever to come to Britannia!''
7: ``When I returned to the surface using the Amulet of Travel and warned my father, we thought all was lost.''
8: ``Thou hast accomplished what none else could, and saved our land!
9: Swiftly, the ship sails away from the wreckage of Cabirus' dreams.
10: At last, you are asleep.
11: For the last three nights, since your triumphant return home, you have been too excited to sleep.
12: Just as you are drifting off, Garamon appears.

7: Tell me more.
8: Oh, is that all?
9: Can I help?
10: I shall leave thee to thy grief if thou wish it so.
11: I shared the great dream of Sir Cabirus, that the Avatar's way could be pursued by all folk.  We sought to gather all intelligent species here in the Abyss and teach them to live in harmony.  Alas, it was not to be.\n The constant bickering proved too much for kindly Sir Cabirus, and he perished in his sleep.  Some said he was poisoned, but I know he died of a broken spirit.\n His life's work was in this place, and as he watched it crumble, his heart broke as well.
12: I am sorry to hear that.  Does aught remain of his dream?
13: A terrible waste.  Did nothing good come of it?
14: He was a fool!
15: Well, aye, Sir Cabirus did gather a number of artifacts with interesting properties. He thought the use of these artifacts might assist the colonists as they pursued the way of the Avatar. Unfortunately, the objects were misused by the folk he hoped to help.
16: How so?
17: I am sorry to hear that
18: Wouldst rather be alone?
19: Each of the eight items gathered by Sir Cabirus embodied one of the Virtues. But those who now possess the items keep them merely for their intrinsic value, not their higher purpose.
20: Such a fool was this Cabirus!
21: A pity, but nothing can be done about it now.
22: Then I shall find these artifacts and put them to proper use.
23: Thou dare to profane his memory!  Begone with thee!
24: Hast thou returned to torment me further?
25: If my presence offends thee, I shall go.
26: Indeed I have, thou mewling child!
27: Get thee from my sight!
28: Nay.  I can help thee now.
29: Hast thou indeed found a way to help?
30: Aye.  But thou must tell me of Sir Cabirus.
31: Get thee from my sight!
32: Nay.  I cannot help thee.
33: Is that all thou hast to say?  Get thee gone from here!
34: Goodbye.
35: Get from here thyself!
36: No, wait.  I can help!
37: Wait!  My cause is lost, but perhaps I can yet help thee.
38: Canst tell me of Sir Cabirus?
39: My thanks, but thou hast done enough.
40: Well, I am beyond thy help!
41: Oh?  Well, fare thee well.
42: Indeed thou art.
43: Nay.  None are truly hopeless.
44: Art thou certain thou dost wish to hear my sorry tale again?
45: Ah, no, what was I thinking?
46: Certainly.  It bears retelling!

1: Greetings to ye.  I am Shak of the Mountain-folk.  What may I do for ye?
2: I need some information.
3: I have need of thy skills.
4: What do ye wish tae ken?
5: What dost thou know of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
6: Where might I find a good weaponsmith?
7: Canst thou teach me to repair items myself?
8: Well, there's no substitute for practice, but I've heard tell that the mantra LON may help ye to repair items with more skill.  Now, can I do anything else for ye?
9: This is in need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?
10: Canst thou tell me what this is?
11: Dost know aught of Cabirus' Talismans?
12: If it's smithing ye need, ye have come to the right man.  But my services are nae cheap.  Can ye pay?
13: No, I cannot.
14: Yes, I'll pay a fair price.
15: Ach, ye're wastin' me time.
16: lad
17: lass
18: Aye, 'tis a fine sword there, @SS1.  I'm afraid it's  seen better days, though.  Dinna fear, I'll make it whole for ye again. But I must charge ye 20 gold pieces for such fine work, paid when you pick it up.
19: Not yet, I have something else to do first.
20: Very well.  Here it is.
21: Ach, ye're wastin' me time
22: Ach, do I look like I have four arms? I can only fix one thing at a time, you know. 
23: Well, I'm afraid this has seen its last fight. 'Tisn't even worth trying to fix.
24: Ah, looks like 'tis half of the Sword Caliburn. Nothing I can do to it without its other half, though!
25: Ach, what do I look like?  This be a smithy, not a trinket shop.  Weapons and armor, that's my work!
26: Ah, ye'll not be bringing me trash like that to fix,  will ye?  'Tisn't worthy of me time.  Look a' it!  S'worthless!  Goblin-work,  no doubt.  No, ye'll be wanting a new one, I'm sure.
27: Ah! This @SS2 is in perfect condition!  There's nothin' I can do for ye.
28: What will ye be needin' fixed, then?
29: Oh, here it is.
30: Oh, never mind...
31: lad
32: lass
33: Well, I'm sorry.  Ye seem like a nice enough @SS1.  Why don't ye go out and kill something and take its hoard?
34: I could, but 'twould not be right!
35: Very well.  I shall return.
36: Ach, verra well then.  Let's have a look.
37: Canst thou tell me what this is?
38: This is in need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?

41: minute
42: minutes
43: Ach, I told ye it would take @GI3C2 minutes. Come back in @SI3C2 @SS2!
44: Ach, 'tis the bold one @SS1!  Wha' may I do for ye?
45: This is in need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?
46: Canst thou tell me what this is?
47: Dost know aught of Cabirus' Talismans?
48: Canst thou help me to repair broken items?
49: Little enough o' most, but I ken well that two o' them were smith-work.  A sword and a shield they were, both fine work.
50: Tell me of this Sword.
51: Tell me of this Shield.
52: The Shield of Valor, it were named.  Never a finer one did I see.  'Twas Blackthorne's once, or so I've 'eard tell.  But it were one o' those things easier to set aside than to take up again, an' he left it when he went to become the conscience for all the world.  Ach, but that were a mess.  Be there aught else I can do for ye?
53: Dost know where the Shield is now?
54: Tell me about the Sword.
55: No, thank you.
56: Aye, now there was a weapon!  Willful, they say, but potent beyond mortal blades.  It had a sense of fair play, did Caliburn.  'Twasn't for naught they called it the Sword o' Justice.  'Twas forged by the great Flamebeard himself.  Would there be anythin' else, then?
57: Dost know where the Sword lies?
58: No, I do not.  Broken into two pieces, I hear it was, but where they are I canna tell ye.
59: No, thank you.
60: Well, ye can see it yourself, now that I've fixed it for ye.  A fine blade, is she not?  'Twill serve ye well, if ye're careful to use it in a just cause.  Be there anything else I can do for ye?
61: This is in need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?
62: Canst thou tell me what this is?
63: No, but I thank thee for thy help.
64: Ah, I dinna ken that a' all.  If ye should see it, let me know!
65: I will indeed.
66: Is this it?
67: That's it all right, the Shield of Valor itself.  Lucky ye are to have found it.  Never a better shield was there fashioned, to my knowledge.  Can I help ye further?
68: That's no Shield of Valor I see!
69: Ah, is this it?
70: I have not found it, then.
71: Well, don't ye give up hope.  If 'twere made, 'twill be found.  Now, is there anything else?
72: This is need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?
73: Canst thou tell me what this is?
74: No, but I thank thee for thy help.
75: Aye, I suppose ye're right.  Perhaps ye might be able to find some valuables lying around somewhere.
76: Very well.  I shall try it.
77: Thanks, but I shall look elsewhere.
78: Do ye want the sword fixed or not?
79: Yes, sorry, here it is.
80: Ach! Ye be wastin' me time for nothing.
81: No, I have changed my mind.
82: Aye, a beauty, this Caliburn.  I'll have her right for ye, soon enough.  Come back in an hour, and don't forget the 20 pieces of gold.
83: Excellent.  I shall see thee then.
84: All right, but hurry.  Time is shorter than thou dost know.
85: piece
86: pieces
87: It'll cost ye @SI4 @SS6 of gold to get this @SS5 fixed up. Do ye want me to go ahead an' fix it then?
88: Yes, please do.
89: No, I have changed my mind.
90: Do you want it fixed or not?
91: Yes, sorry, here it is.
92: Ach! Ye be wastin' me time for nothing.
93: No, I have changed my mind.
94: All right, I'll have it ready for ye in @GI3C2 minutes.   An' don't forget the @SI4 @SS6 of gold!
95: Excellent.  I shall see thee then.
96: All right, but hurry.  Time is short.
97: There ye are.  'Tis right as rain now.
98: Here, I'll just put it on the floor for ye.
99: Thank thee.  Thou art truly a craftsman. 
100: Well, 'tis about time!
101: Well, ye'll have to come back when ye can pay me.  'Tis quality work, ye know!
102: Ach, ye're wastin' me time!
103: Well, what is it ye want me to look at?
104: Oh, here it is.
105: Forgive me, I have changed my mind.

108: Sorry, never mind.
109: gold piece
110: gold pieces
111: Why, it seems ye've found part of the Sword Caliburn.  A fine sword that would be, if made whole!  Now, is there anything else?
112: Why, that's @SS15.  Anything more?
113: Why, that's @SS15, worth about @SI18 @SS16.  Anything more?
114: I have something that is in need of repair.
115: I need something else identified.
116: Canst tell me of Cabirus' Talismans?
117: No, but thank thee.
118: Well, I don't work for free ye know! Will there be anything else then?
119: I have something that is in need of repair.
120: I need something else identified.
121: Canst tell me of Cabirus' Talismans?
122: No, but thank thee.
123: There ye are, all fixed now!  A beauty, she is, and good as new.
124: Here, I'll just put it on the floor for ye.
125: Thank thee.  Thou hast done more than thou knowest.
126: Well, it's about time!
127: Well, ye'll have to come back when ye can pay me.  'Tis quality work, ye know!
128: Would ye be needin' anything else?
129: Canst tell me of Cabirus' Talismans?
130: Can you tell me what this is?
131: This is in need of repair also.  Canst thou help?
132: No, but thank thee.
133: gold piece
134: gold pieces
135: Well now, do ye have the @PI-3 @SS23 ye owe me for the work?

137: Yes, here thou art.
138: No, I don't have it now.
139: Sorry, here is thy money.
140: I'm sorry, I cannot pay thee.
141: Well, are ye payin' me or ain't ye?
142: Ah! Thank ye for the tip. I can see ye appreciate fine work when ye see it! Come again!
143: Ye're not makin' a down payment ye know!
144: I take me payment in gold, I'm nae a pawnshop!
145: Farewell then.
146: Would ye like to trade items?
147: Yes.
148: No.
149: I make thee this offer.
150: I demand that thou givest me these items.
151: Excuse me, I must think about this deal.
152: I do not wish to barter any further.
153: Farewell.
154: I accept your offer.
155: No, I do not like this deal.
156: Do ye take me for a fool?
157: I am weary of this haggling.
158: Are ye joking with me?
159: Do ye intend to rob me?
160: Yes, I must.
161: No, thou dost misunderstand me.
162: If ye insist, ye can have them.
163: No! Ye shall not take them!

2: Well met, Lord Goldthirst.
3: Thank thee, O Dwarf-King.
4: Greetings, your Majesty.
5: Majesty, is it?  Well, thou art good at flattery, if nothing else!
6: It would be difficult to flatter one so noble as thee, your Majesty.
7: I beg thy pardon.  I did not intend to insult thy intelligence with flattery.
8: Thou hast a fine tongue, and a sense of courtesy.  Hast thou other Virtues as well?
9: I am a paragon, embodying every Virtue, my Lord.
10: None worth mentioning, milord.
11: Call me that again, and thy tongue shall wag without thy head around it!
12: That is quite enough.  Hast thou some reason for coming here?
13: I would see thy hoard.
14: I am in search of adventure.
15: I bring thee this gift.
16: Thou shalt see it for thyself!  Take thee to the end of the hall from which thou didst enter and say the words "Deco Morono" to the guard at the door.
17: I thank thee.
18: Thou art truly a noble dwarf.
19: Well!  Thou art aware that it is customary to offer a gift when granted an audience?
20: No, I was not, my lord.  I have nothing worthy here.
21: Indeed.  Here is thy gift.
22: Ah, but I am giving thee the blessing of my company!
23: My apologies. We have different customs where I come from.
24: That's quite all right.  Nothing fancy is needed, just a token.  A little . . . GOLD will do.
25: Here is thy gift.
26: Nay, I spoke truly.  I have nothing to give.
27: No, I cannot help thee with that.
28: Is there some other way I can help thee?
29: Thou canst not toy with me!
30: But thou art empty handed! Dost thou really wish to give me a gift?
31: Yes, I'm sorry, here it is...
32: No, I have no gift worthy of thee.
33: This is indeed a goodly gift, and I thank thee for it most kindly.  Wouldst care to see the treasure chamber to which it will be added?
34: Oh, yes, very much!
35: No, but I thank thee.
36: Only if your lordship insists.
37: It will do, I suppose.  Thou mayst go now.
38: Ungrateful wretch!  A pox on thee and thy greed!
39: Thy graciousness is overwhelming.  Good-day.
40: Indeed, I suppose thou wouldst.  Many should like to see my treasure . . .  touch it, stroke it, perhaps STEAL it!  That is what thou wouldst like, isn't it? To rob me blind after I was foolist enough to invite thee here!\n GUARDS!  GUARDS!  ARREST THIS THIEF!
41: 'Twas not my intent to upset thee.  Call off thy guards. I will leave.
42: You'll never take @GS8 alive!
43: Well then.  What is the reason for thy visit?
44: I bring thee this gift.
45: I am seeking adventure.
46: Merely to meet thee.
47: Perhaps we can help each other . . . I have need of such an adventurer as thyself.  Our mines have been invaded by a terrible monster!
48: Indeed?  Perhaps I can help!
49: That is too bad.  Good day to thee.
50: I believe that I have slain the beast already.
51: That is well.  I have need of a paragon, just now.  Art thou aware that my people's mine has been invaded by a monster?
52: Indeed?  Perhaps I can help!
53: That is too bad.  A good day to thee.
54: I believe that I have slain the beast already.
55: Excellent!  A hero at last. My people, at least those not too valuable to lose, are all too afraid of the beast to dare face it!  It is a fearsome beast, covered with tentacles and with many eyes.  If thou art brave enough, and you slay the creature, I shall reward thee handsomely!
56: It shall be done!
57: We shall see.
58: I knew thou wert a hero!  Was it difficult?
59: Extraordinarily so.  None but I could have succeeded.
60: Yes.  I was fortunate to have slain it.
61: We are then fortunate that thou wert the one to undertake the task. Thou hast our thanks.  Was there anything else?
62: I pray thee, accept this humble gift.
63: Thou art most welcome.  Farewell.
64: And modest as well!  Truly, thou art worthy of this great reward!  Here!
65: A small, stooped member of the race of Mountain-folk scuttles forward, presenting to you a small amulet cast in the shape of a stone-cutter's chisel.\m
66: This was the favored tool of Great Coulnes, the best gemcutter ever to grace our tribe.  It is traditionally presented to heroes and those who excel in their craft.  Thou art the first not of our folk to bear it.  May it bring thee fortune.  Again, our thanks.
67: \mI will leave it here for ye.
68: Thou art welcome.  Accept this gift in return.
69: I thank thee.  Farewell.
70: Greetings, bold @GS8.  Hast thou managed to kill the vicious monster infesting our mines?
71: Yes, the deed has been done.
72: No, it has still eluded me.
73: I have been busy with other quests.
74: Ah, @GS8!  It is a pleasure to see thee again.  Thy name shall go down in the history of our clan!
75: And rightfully so.
76: I do not deserve such praise.
77: I thank thee.  Here is a gift for you.
78: Well, we are glad that thou hast visited us.  Do say hello again when thou art in the vicinity.  Thy company is always welcome.
79: Oh, pish.  Thou bearest the amulet of Coulnes, a testament to thy heroics.  As long as this clan lives, we shall remember thee.
80: Thou art humble as well as brave!  Surely thou deservest a reward.
81: Hm.  Perhaps thou art not so great a warrior as I first suspected.
82: Thou may be right.
83: I will do my best to vanquish the beast.
84: Oh, 'tis thee again.  Is there a reason for thy visit?
85: Greetings, bold @GS8.  What brings thee back to our hall?
86: I have a gift for your Lordship.  I trust it pleases thee.
87: I have another gift for your Lordship.
88: I am in search of adventure.
89: I merely wished to pay my respects, your Lordship.  I must be going.
90: Thou canst not toy with me!
91: But thou art empty handed! Dost thou really wish to give me a gift?
92: Yes, I'm sorry, here it is...
93: No, I have no gift worthy of thee.
94: 'Tis a fine gift.  I thank thee kindly.
95: Thou art welcome.  Farewell.
96: I am glad thou dost enjoy it.
97: Zounds!  A larger lump of gold I have never seen!  Surely thou art deserving of this axe, an honored weapon that has been passed down from the time of my ancestors.  Use it well, for there are few weapons better.

55: I am not currently on a quest.
56: Hmm.  No quest, hah?  What kind of knight you be with no quest?
57: Gifts Cabirus was going to give out?  That long time ago, before we was even Ghouls.  Me not hear of them talmans since crazy wizard talking 'bout justice come and seal off tombs.
58: Tell me of this wizard.
59: Before you were Ghouls?

84: I think I know a way to make the villain confess . . .  
85: Say thou'rt glad someone poisoned this ghoul, because he attempted to force his attentions upon thee.  When the guilty one claims a reward, seize him!

104: Nasty person, you still talk to me?
105: I no feel like talking to you.
106: Hold a feast, and announce partway through that the meal is from the poisoned one's stock.  The guilty one will know 'twas poisoned, and give himself away.
107: Wait . . .  what was thy problem again?
108: You smart!  That clever AND fair!  Not too often me hear of anyone fair in Abyss.  Last time was when crazy wizard guy was around talking about justice.

112: Perhaps.  I shall see.  Thank thee.
113: Ghouls used to live in tombs, lots of food there. After big collapse, crazy wizard come here,  talking 'bout justice. He throw us out of tombs.  Said ghouls no care about justice so we no could live there anymore. He put part of sword in tombs too, I think.

116: G'bye.

13: When didst thou last see a live human here?
14: None of thy business!
15: Me Eyesnack.  What you doing here?
16: I am exploring the Abyss.
17: Eyesnack.  That is a peculiar name.
18: You strange person, wander around exploring.  Since collapse 'most no one come here.
19: Why did people come here before the collapse?
20: Why don't people come here anymore?
21: This place was catacombs.  People come to state hall for funeral, then march through catacombs and make tomb for dead guy.  Me play flute at funerals.  Long time ago.
22: Thou didst play the flute?
23: I would not expect thee to be a musician.
24: Yeah, me musician.  You surprised Ghoul can be musician?  Me musician before me Ghoul.  Me play in state hall for Cabirus all the time.
25: What didst thou play for Cabirus?
26: I'm sure thou didst play wonderfully.
27: It was great.  Me play all kinds stuff.  Me play "Mardin's Song of Wonder" lot of times.  Was Cabirus' favorite spiritual.  Said that you play it in the right place, wondrous thing happen.  But no one know place.
28: Really?  How did it go?
29: I'd like to try to play it.
30: You got flute?  Me teach song to you.

38: I shall be sure to practice it.
39: Thank thee, Eyesnack.
40: Okay, get flute and me teach you song.
41: Whole floor of Abyss was used for meetings.  Was state hall, tombs, meeting rooms.  No one lived here, just came for meetings.  After collapse, meetings stop and people no come here.
42: What was this particular area?
43: Why do the ghouls live here now?
44: When collapse happen, food get scarce fast.  Bunch of us who work here before collapse live off bodies in tombs. Start to like them better than other food.  Other humans call us ghouls.  Pretty soon we call selves Ghouls.  Later we kicked out of tombs, move here.
45: What was thy job here before the collapse?
46: Who kicked thee out of the tombs?
47: Some wizard.  Me no remember for sure.  Shanklick, leader of Ghouls, know about wizard. Ask her.
48: What was thy job here before the collapse?
49: I shall ask her, then.  Farewell.

54: Er...I see.  Didst thou say something about humans?
55: Sounds delicious.
56: Hey, you okay for human!  Most complain about Ghouls, say they evil for eating guys.  Me think they just jealous because we no hungry all time like them.
57: What were things like here before the collapse?
58: Me see humans here long time ago before collapse.  Before Ghouls even exist.  We all just humans then.
59: What did humans do here before the collapse?
60: What dost thou mean, before Ghouls exist?
61: You rotten live human.  Me no talk to you.
62: Me no want to talk to you. You make me mad.

25: I know nothing of no girl!  I've got problems of me own.
26: Such as?
27: I am sure thou hast.  I shall be going.
28: Well, canst thou tell me aught of the Abyss?
29: My enemies are legion.  Even the vermin here are troublesome.  A great she-spider, known as Navrey Night-eyes, threatens my folk.  Nor is she my only problem, though she is enough.  Her web, ye know, be strong as iron, and does not burn.  A Goblin caught in it will stay 'till he rots!
30: Terrible!
31: Perhaps I can help.
32: Do not be a fool!  None can slay the dread Navrey!  Now, ye came here for something.
33: I be Ketchaval, the mighty leader of the last holding of the noble Goblins, the Gray tribe.\n Years ago, when we were lured here by that sweet-talking fool, Cabirus, we noble Grays brought with us our servants, the lowly and ignorant Green Goblins, to care for us in our new homes.\m
34: We later granted them their freedom, and equal citizenship, though all knew we did them more honor than they were worth.  And see how they rewarded us!  They split off when Cabirus' "civilization" fell, and have opposed us ever since.\n Only my leadership has kept us together in the face of such opposition.
35: Such a job must have many cares.
36: Have the Greens no redeeming value?
37: I am glad for thee.  Farewell.
38: None whatever!  They are distrusting, vindictive, and calculating.  But enough of them!

40: I need to find a girl.
41: I seek knowledge of Cabirus.
42: Thou hast helped me already.  I thank thee.  I must be going.
43: A human fool named Cabirus convinced many of our people to come here and colonize this accursed place.  When his dreams were shown to be mere folly, he killed himself -- by taking poison -- and left us to our fates.
44: Tragic!
45: Ah, well, I must be going now.  Goodbye!
46: Indeed, 'tis not fair!  Still, we must persevere.  Was there anything else?
47: No.  I thank thee.  Farewell.

10: I have quested long to drink from the fountain of thy wisdom, O pearl among kings.
11: True!  I AM rather wise, come to think of it.  What dost thou wish to know?
12: Who was Sir Cabirus?
13: What are these Talismans of which I hear?
14: Tell me of the races of the Abyss.
15: How came you by that gorgeous cloak?
16: Well... Perhaps thou canst be forgiven.  This place IS full of the most frightfully rude people.  Thou mayst remain.  What is thy need?
17: Merely to partake in some small manner of thy vast knowledge.
18: Nothing.  I'm leaving.
19: I require some information.
20: I've changed my mind about thee!  Thou art indeed a ruffian!  Get thee hence!
21: Thou hast the manners of an acid slug!  Get out of here!
22: Thou art entirely too generous with thy time!
23: Perhaps thou couldst stand a little further downwind?
24: I do most humbly crave thy pardon.
25: Thou art a dandified fool!
26: It does suit me, doesn't it?  I had it made especially for me.  One simply doesn't find work like this underground.\n Well, perhaps the Mountain-folk do make a few nice things, but they tend toward metals rather than clothes.\n And of course the Seers -- the Ancient Illuminated Seers of the Moonstone, they call themselves -- they do nice work, too.  But they generally tend more toward the literary than the sartorial arts.
27: Who was Sir Cabirus?
28: What are these Talismans of which I hear?
29: What are the power groups within the Abyss?
30: And this hall?  It is most beautiful.
31: Well, one does what one can.  Of course those awful Gray Goblins took all the really nice things with them when they stole away in the night -- this was just after Sir Cabirus died, you know, when things were falling apart -- and we've had to make do since then.\n One of these days I'm going to get some poison into Ketchaval or his ugly wife (which amounts to the same thing -- he's terribly henpecked, you know), and then we'll see what's what.  King of the Gray Goblins, indeed.\m
32: Why he's an upstart!  His father was a horse-thief! But enough of this ... You wanted to know something?  How can I help you?
33: What are these Talismans of which I hear?
34: I would like to know about Sir Cabirus.
35: Canst tell me more of the groups in the Abyss?
36: 'Tis very kind of thee to take time to help me, your majesty.
37: Oh, mention it not!  It is so seldom that I get a chance to speak to a really intelligent person!\n I mean, our allies the Lizardmen are nice enough, but the poor fellows can't speak a word of the common tongue. They understand it well enough, but the poor things don't have the mouth to speak it.  And their language is so difficult! I know "Sseth" and "'click" mean "yes" and "no," but I don't know which is which!\m
38: Then there are the Knights of the Crux Ansata -- they can talk well enough, but all they ever say is how many Trolls they've killed.  Frightful bore, even if it does help keep the pest population down -- both kinds of pests, Knights AND Trolls, you know.
39: It must be a trial, even for one as noble as yourself.
40: What of these Talismans?
41: I would like to know about Sir Cabirus.
42: Are there other groups here in the Abyss?
43: Oh, indeed it is!  Sometimes I wonder how I even manage.  It wasn't always like this, you know.\n When Sir Cabirus was alive, things were ever so much better.  He had all of us working together so well.  A born leader was that man.\n When he founded this colony you could have made a wager anywhere in Britannia that it wouldn't work, but he made it so.\n I still think one of those bastard Grays must have done him in. There were certain items, too...\m
44: Well, I suppose it will do no harm to tell thee.  Sir Cabirus collected eight great Talismans, each embodying a certain Virtue -- he was a great one for Virtue, was our Cabirus -- and it was well known that he intended them to come to the leaders of the various groups here in the Abyss.  Well, WE never saw them.  If they still exist, they must be lost.\n But I must be boring thee.
45: Well, actually, yes.
46: No, not at all.
47: I could listen forever, your Majesty, but I've taken enough of thy time.
48: Well, bless you, you're such a charming conversationalist.  Please do visit again.
49: Well!  I never!
50: Well thou hast now!
51: I beg thy pardon, but I must go now.
52: Oh, thou'rt just saying that.  I'm sure there's much more for thee to do than listen me me natter on.\n And if you should happen to meet "King" Ketchaval or "Queen" Retichall of the Gray Goblins, be a dear and stick a knife in them, would you?
53: Farewell, your Majesty.

32: Perhaps we should discuss this.
33: Very well.  Thou hast earned death by coming here, and thou shalt have thy reward.  Here is a cup, which bears within it a venom both swift and deadly.  Take it and drink it.
34: Very well.
35: And if I refuse?
36: Then thou art no candidate worthy of our Order! Leave here, and return when thou art.
37: Ah, good Sir Cabirus!  Many of our Order seek his Talismans, for they are said to confer Virtue both in the seeking and the finding.  I cannot, however, share our knowledge about these things with one who is not an initiate of our Order.
38: May I join thy Order?
39: Very well.  I understand.  Good day to thee.
40: You take the cup.  Within it is a is a clear, odorless liquid.  You raise it to your lips and . . .  
41: Fling it to the floor.
42: Drink it in a draught.
43: He
44: She
45: his
46: her
47: The taste of it is like pure water.  You wait for several moments, and nothing happens.  Then a voice cries out in mourning and a funeral dirge plays. 
48: @SS1 who drank from the cup is now dead.  In @SS2 place stands @GS8, Esquire of the Order of the Crux Ansata.  Tell me, wert thou afraid?
49: Yes.
50: No.
51: Good!  To know fear is the first step to knowing Valor.  Thou art now a Squire of this Order.\m
52: Thy quest is to find the writ of Lorne, a document written by one of the the first Knights who settled this order in the Abyss.\n  The document was written during the early years of the Colony, and it contains much knowledge of that time.  However, it is now gone, though many suspect it is in the troll homeland.\n Seek it, and when thou returns here with it, a knight of our order thou wilt become.
53: I thank thee.  May I prove worthy of the honor.  Fare thee well.
54: I thank thee.  Canst thou tell me aught of Cabirus' Talismans?  They are also my quest.
55: Brother
56: Sister
57: Precious little.  They numbered eight, and Cabirus did intend them to go each to one of the Leaders of the eight groups who settled the Abyss.  Alas, he perished, and all eight were lost.\n 'Tis said they were a Book, bottle of Wine, a Shield, a Sword, a Taper, a Standard, a Cup, and a Ring.  Each was imbued with the potent power of a single Virtue, and 'tis said they confer Virtue both in the seeking and the finding.\m
58: Of the Standard thou dost know, since thou hast earned it by defeating Rodrick, the Chaos Knight.  The Taper was stolen, unfortunately. Thou seest how the virtues have suffered since the death of Cabirus.
59: I know only of the Taper and the Standard.  The Taper of Sacrifice was stolen from us only recently, and we know not its current whereabouts. As for the Standard of Honor, it is said that it is awaiting one who would perform a sufficiently honorable deed.
60: Farewell, Brother, and thanks!
61: Goodbye.
62: That is good.  To learn is to better oneself.  How may we advance thy knowledge?
63: Tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus.
64: What knowest thou of the Trolls?
65: Tell me of thy order.
66: The Trolls?  They are our ancient foes.  We are fortunate in that many of them are honorable, in their own way.  Some are not, of course.  Feral Trolls, we call them. Beware of these.  All are deadly foes, but at least the civilized ones fight honorably.
67: Thank thee for the advice.
68: Thy standards appeal to me.  How may I join thy Order?
69: Greeting, Squire @GS8!  How didst thou fare in thy quest?
70: I have succeeded!  Here is the writ.
71: I have not yet completed my quest.
72: Sir
73: Lady
74: Hail, @SS1 @GS8!  How fares thy quest?
75: I have succeeded!  Here is the plate.
76: I have not yet completed my quest.
77: Sir
78: Lady
79: Now thou art @SS1 @GS8, Knight of the Order of the Crux Ansata. Take thou this helm of plate, worthy of a Knight.  Would that we had a horse to give thee as well, for 'tis proper for a Knight.
80: Here, I'll just put it on the floor for thee.
81: Are there any more lost artifacts in need of retrieval?
82: How else may I serve the Order?
83: Thou hast done well; thy quest is accomplished.  Well done!\m
84: No, I am afraid that is not the writ.
85: Perhaps this is it.
86: I will return when I have found it.
87: Good luck in thy continuing quest.
88: There shall be no discussion.  Thou mayst go or stay, and accept the consequences of thy decision.
89: I shall stay.
90: Very well.
91: I shall be going.
92: Return when thou art truly ready to become an initiate of our order.
93: Thy quest is accomplished. Well done!\n All things that belong to the order now belong  to thee.  I have opened the door to the armory, and thou mayst go there and take items as thou dost need them to accomplish  the quests and goals thou dost set for thyself.
94: Now what wouldst thou have of me?
95: I thank thee. Now I must be going.
96: That is not it. Try again.
97: All that I can tell thee I have told.  Seek the virtues on thy own through what is left of our once noble colony.  Good luck and honor on thy quests.
98: Thou hast killed the bastard knight who held the north of our home to be his.  I thank thee for bringing honor back to our order and clearing the villain from our homes.\n The action thou hast taken has proven that thou art most worthy.  To reward thee for thy deeds, I offer thee the Standard of Honor, one of the Talismans fashioned by Cabirus.
99: My thanks.  I am honored indeed to bear it.
100: No thank you.  I would not know what to do with it.
101: Hast thou reconsidered my offer?
102: Yes, I desire the standard of honor.
103: No thank thee, I must be going.
104: No, but I would like to speak with thee.
105: I shall speak with thee, but I strongly urge thee to take this standard.
106: Dorna turns and rummages through a large iron case, returning soon with a golden standard which he holds before you.
107: Here it is.  Bear it with honor and remember those who bore it before thee.  Honor their memory with thy deeds, for the deeds  thou hast already done honor thee in our memory.
108: Here, I'll just put it on the floor for you.
109: I thank thee, and shall take thy words to heart.
110: If thou dost ever desire it, return to me and ask for it.
111: I shall, and soon.
112: Both it and I shall be waiting.
113: Thou shalt wait a long time afore I return, I believe.
114: We shall see.
115: The order once owned a golden plate.  Years ago it was stolen by a thief who I will not even describe, for he is not worth the time it would take.  He fled into the maze and was not seen again.\n Since then, it was rumored to have been found several times.  The last rumor placed it at the grave of Sir Ingvar.  Find it and thou wilt rise even further as a Knight.
116: I thank thee.  Until we meet again...
117: Another quest!  Is there no end?
118: Thou hast seen the truth of it!  The quest for enlightenment is never-ending. Yet, if thou dost persist in this small quest, thou mayst find rewards to help thee  on the greater quest.
119: Very well.  Until we meet again...
120: I am sorry to hear it.  Hast spoken to all in this area?  Surely someone can help thee?
121: If I must...  Farewell.
122: I'll try.  Until we meet again...
123: Thou art one of us now.  Thou art always welcome here.
124: I thank thee and am glad to hear that.
125: Wouldst thou please reopen the armory?
126: Surely.  I'll have it done right away.
127: What canst thou tell me of Sir Cabirus' Talismans?
128: Well I am glad thou desirest my company.  However, I am a very busy man, and I don't have time now to talk.  Many of the knights of the order are willing to reminisce and talk.  Thou shouldst seek them out.
129: Thank thee, and farewell.
130: Canst thou just tell me a bit of the nature of thy order?
131: Our goal is that of the Avatar - to advance in our knowledge of virtue, in order to better ourselves.  When a quest presents itself that will further our understanding of virtue, we undertake it gladly.  Perhaps our quests also make Britannia a better place.\m
132: Unfortunately, Rodrick, one of our order, recently abandoned his principles and took up residence in the banquet hall to the north, calling himself the "Chaos Knight" and terrorizing the inhabitants of that area.  We sent one of our knights, Biden, to defeat him, but he has not returned.  I fear the worst.
133: Thank thee, and farewell.
134: May I join thy order?
135: Perhaps I could defeat him.
136: That would be most honorable of thee, if thou didst truly defeat him and restore peace to our settlement.  But I must warn thee that he is an opponent as dishonorable as he is dangerous, and he would not likely spare thy life were he to outfight thee.
137: I will take care with him, then.
138: May I join thy order?
139: Thank thee for thy advice, and farewell.

1: Hail to thee, bold traveller.  I am Morlock.
2: Excuse me, I must be going.
3: What canst thou tell me of thy people?
4: I have something for thee.
5: I am in search of adventure.
6: Well, I can tell thee that one of my comrades, the mage Bronus, has need of thy services.  Deliver to me an object of his,  and thou shalt be rewarded.
7: In fact, I have already acquired that object from him.
8: Perhaps I shall run across him.
9: I have no interest in running errands.
10: Ah!  Well, I believe that my fellow mage Bronus has something for me.  If thou wouldst deliver it to me, perhaps I can help thee further.
11: In fact, I have already acquired that object from him.
12: Perhaps I shall run across him.
13: I have no interest in running errands.
14: That is too bad.  If thou changest thy mind, do not hesitate to talk to me again!
15: Ah!  Thou hast brought my book!  Excellent!
16: Thou sayest thou hast something for me?
17: Yes, here it is.
18: No, thou dost misunderstand.
19: None of this is mine.  Dost thou really have an item of mine?
20: Yes, here it is.
21: No, I'm afraid not.
22: Perhaps the errand was too difficult for thee.  But no matter.
23: Well, if thou dost acquire that object, please do not delay in bringing it to me.
24: Thou art @GS8, art thou not?
25: Aye, that is my name.
26: Nay.  I have not heard of this @GS8.
27: Thou knowest I am.
28: Ah!  Why didst thou not say so?
29: I was simply going to reward thee for bringing me my book, but now I hear that thou hast met and slain the fearsome Fire Hydra. That eight-headed monster has long menaced our peaceable folk.  Well done!  Thou hast earned an even greater reward!
30: Assuredly.  I was wondering from whom I might get my reward.
31: I beg thy pardon.  I slew no such beast.
32: him
33: her
34: A pity.  I have heard much good said of @SS1.
35: Oh, THAT @GS8!  Ah, yes, that is me.
36: What hast thou heard?
37: he
38: she
39: Only that @SS1 was a paragon of honesty.
40: him
41: her
42: Ah, thou didst speak of me, then.  Thou didst mispronounce my name so badly that I misunderstood thee.
43: Well, if I should meet @GS8, I shall greet @SS1 for thee.  Goodbye.
44: Ah, I had thought as much.  Thou didst fit the description.
45: Thy reward shall be a powerful book.  Thou shalt find it in a room behind a secret door in the Library.
46: Thank thee.  I shall be on my way to collect my reward.
47: Hmm.  Well, excuse me, I must be going.
48: Thy honesty is commendable, and thy reward shall be the Book of Honesty.  As Honesty and Truth are beyond Time, thou shalt find it by the key behind the hourglass.
49: Well, I thank thee.  I shall be off to retrieve it now.
50: What can thou tell me of this Book?
51: The book was one of Sir Cabirus' Talismans.  'Twas written by Ravenhurst of Moonglow, who collected great works of honesty and essays upon Truth.  It hath great power, both intrinsically and for the wisdom contained therein.
52: Well, I thank thee.  I shall be off to retrieve it now.
53: Thank thee.
54: Hello again.  Hast thou an object for me?
55: Yes, here it is.
56: No, I do not.
57: Of what object dost thou speak?
58: My fellow mage Bronus wishes to deliver something to me.  Seek him out. If thou bringst the object to me, I may reward thee.
59: Ah, it is @GS8 again.
60: Greetings once more.  Hast thou found @GS8 yet?
61: Actually, I am @GS8.
62: No, I have not.
63: Well, if thou findest @GS8, please let me know.  I am looking for him.
64: Hello again.  What dost thou want from me now?
65: I merely wanted to thank thee again.
66: I was just stopping by to say hello.
67: I must admit that I slew no Fire Hydra.
68: Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found thy reward?
69: Yes, and I thank thee.
70: No, not yet.
71: I must admit that I do not deserve this reward.  I slew no Fire Hydra.
72: How kind of thee.  I wish thee continued luck with thy quests.
73: I hope thou useth it well, for thou richly deserveth it.
74: It should not be hard to find.
75: Remember, it lies with the key behind the hourglass.
76: Remember, it is behind a secret door in the Library.
77: Ah!  The truth is out!  Well, at least thou wert honest eventually.  I am not sure whether thou really deservest the Book of Honesty, but perhaps thou hast learned from thy mistakes.  As Honesty and Truth are beyond Time, thou shalt find it by the key behind the hourglass.
78: Thank thee, and farewell.
79: Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found thy reward?
80: Yes, and I thank thee kindly.
81: No, not yet.
82: Thy directions were quite confusing.
83: Congratulations!  I hope that it will prove useful to thee.
84: Congratulations again on thy discovery.  I wish thee luck in thy continuing quest.
85: I make thee this offer.
86: I demand thou givest me these items.
87: Excuse me, I must think about this deal.
88: I do not wish to barter any further.
89: Farewell.
90: I accept thy offer.
91: No, I do not like this deal.
92: Dost thou take me for a fool?
93: I am weary of this haggling.
94: Surely thou art joking.
95: Dost thou intend to rob me?
96: Yes, I must.
97: No, thou dost misunderstand me.
98: If thou dost insist, thou canst have them.
99: No! Thou shalt not take them!

3: I am in trouble, and only the wise Dr. Owl can assist me.

5: I came here to learn courtesy from a master.
6: Ah!  Sarcasm!  Very well, thou hast made thy point!  Now, quickly, what dost thou need?
7: Canst tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
8: I seek some missing runestones.
9: I have no more runestones for thee!  Perhaps thou shouldst learn to use the ones thou hast.
10: Perhaps I can help thee after all, but first I will need to see thy runebag.
11: Certainly.  Here it is.
12: No, I am sorry.  I dare not let this out of my hands.
13: Ah, yes.  A budding mage indeed.  I suppose thou wouldst like to have a Flam runestone?
14: Surely.

16: Yes?
17: Yes, here is my runebag.
18: No, I dare not part with it.
19: Here thou art.  I wish thee luck in using it.
20: Here thou art.  Now, do not expect me to teach thee to use it.  That is not my job!  Was there anything else, or may I return to my work in peace?
21: No, but thank thee.
22: Yes.  Canst thou tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
23: What work art thou doing?
24: Where is that accursed stone?  I must have lost it.
25: I thank thee kindly, Dr. Owl.
26: I will use it well.
27: Very well, very well.  Now get on with thee!
28: I am divining.  I seek my mute servant, Murgo, who is missing.
29: Perhaps I might find him for thee.
30: I am sorry to hear it.
31: Bah!  What is it THIS time?
32: Canst thou tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
33: I seek some missing runestones.
34: I beg thy pardon, I thought thou wert another.
35: I know where there is a bottle of the so-called Wine of Compassion!  Bah!  Such foolishness.  Only babes and fools believe in such fairy-stories.
36: Wilt thou tell me where to find it?
37: Thou'rt probably right.  Sorry to have bothered thee.
38: If thou canst locate and return my missing servant Murgo, I shall tell thee where to find the Wine of Compassion.
39: Then I shall find him and return him.
40: Never mind.  Thou art too much trouble.
41: If I see him I shall let thee know.
42: Very well, have it thy way!  Was there anything else, or may I return to my work in peace?
43: No, but thank thee.
44: Yes.  Canst thou tell me of the talismans of Sir Cabirus?
45: What work art thou doing?
46: I have no time for idle chit-chat!  Be off with thee!
47: Bah!  Nonsense!  Get thyself gone from here, or I shall make thee wish thou had!
48: Very well, then.  Goodbye!
49: No!  Wait!  My need is great.
50: A pity, then, that thou art not more civil to thy betters.  What will it take to get thee to leave me in peace?
51: Canst tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
52: I seek some missing runestones.
53: Nothing.  I'll not bother thee again.
54: Well?  Hast thou news of my servant?
55: Yes.  Murgo lies above in the dungeons of the Lizardmen.
56: Nay.  I have seen him not.
57: Thou canst find the Wine of Compassion in the checkerboard room to the east of the meeting hall of the Academy.  Lift the southeastern floor tile and the Wine shall be revealed.
58: Thank thee, and farewell.
59: While I am here, dost thou know of any runestones I can find?
60: 'Tis thee again.  I note that Murgo has not been returned to me.  Wert thou not going to find him in return for directions to the Wine of Compassion?
61: Yes, I am still looking.
62: I shall endeavor to bring him back promptly.
63: Perhaps later.
64: Obviously thou'rt not a great adventurer. A great adventurer would surely have succeeded in thy quest by now!
65: 'Tis thee again.  What dost thou want?
66: Nothing, I was just leaving.
67: What art thou so busy with?
68: I seek new runestones.
69: Ah, it is the one who hast freed my servant Murgo!  Thou'rt more compassionate towards thy fellows than I might expect.  Thy reward shall be fitting.
70: Greetings, @GS11.  What dost thou want?  I warn thee, I am quite busy.
71: I cannot seem to find the Wine of Compassion.
72: It's quite simple.
73: Canst thou direct me to more runestones?
74: I'm sorry, I did not mean to bother thee.

38: Not welcome here thou art!
39: What you here brings?
40: Again, a greeting to you I give.
41: Your pardon, I must be going.
42: Wait!  Please help me!
43: I have news of Ossikka!
44: Dost have any news of the world?
45: I have more questions about the sword.
46: Of you I worry.  Perhaps I should not help.
47: Fine.  I bid thee goodbye.
48: Oh, please, kind Ishtass.  Can you not help me?
49: Is good thing Ishtass nice.  Many civilized groups are still found in the Abyss and must be treated with much kindness.  Important it is to know this.
50: Please, adventurer, what Ossikka news have you?
51: I have found this.
52: No news yet.  Sorry.
53: This nothing me tells.  Please something of Ossikka find?
54: I will continue my search.
55: Oh.  How about this?
56: Why yes, of this Ossikka did have.  Oh, what means this?
57: I found his bones in a room upstream.
58: Sorry day, indeed.  Still, thank you.  Here, a gift for you is.
59: On floor, I leave it for you.
60: Thank you very much.
61: Canst thou now tell me of the sword?
62: What you to know want?
63: You have told me enough.  Thank you.
64: Where can I find the Sword?
65: Sword in two pieces broken is.  Wizard took haft below.  Ossikka clue to blade found, he said.  Blade somewhere in our domain is, I think.  More than that I do not know.
66: Thank you for your help.
67: I will continue my search.

8: Wouldst thou like anything?
9: What kind of things didst thou collect?
10: Oh, I would love wormy stew.  My mother she made it when I just a little troll.  You have any?
11: Yes, here is some.
12: No, but I will look for some.
13: No.  How is it made?
14: Hmm... I no remember.  I know you use dead rotworm.  My mother knew, but she dead.  Maybe someone else.  Oh, that stew delicious!
15: I will try to make some.
16: I will seek out someone who knows the recipe.
17: Hmm, let me see... Aha!  I still have dragon scales.  I kill nasty dragon when I was a young troll.  Big and breathed fire.  It could sit on lava forever without burning up.  I kill it and save its scales.  Never use them though.  Now I old troll, I like simple pleasures, I no need them. Maybe if you give me something, I trade for scales.
18: What wouldst thou like?
19: Maybe I can trade thee some gold.
20: No, I no need treasure any more.  Just simple nice things like wormy stew.
21: Hello, you again!  You bring wormy stew for me?
22: Yes, here it is.

6: I am guilty of naught but misfortune.
7: What dost thou mean?
8: Innocent, eh?  Why, so are we all, falsely accused every one of us!
9: It grieves me to hear it.  Can nothing be done?
10: Well, I must take my leave.  Farewell.
11: Speaking of innocence, hast seen a maiden in distress?
12: Begone, liar!  Thou art a charlatan and worse!
13: A young girl was this?  Beauteous, but innocent?
14: Aye, that was she.
15: I never saw her.  I am innocent of the charge.
16: I would assume so.
17: We did see her but hours agone, carried by a troll and pursued by a pack of fools!  They fell afoul of the Gobs, to be sure.
18: Ah, she is long gone by now.  A troll carried her below. Almric's men were in pursuit, but they proved no match for the Gobs.
19: The "Gobs?"
20: I thank thee.  I must seek them to prove my innocence!
21: Where be she now?
22: Still, I must recover her to clear my name.  Goodbye.
23: Aye, the Goblins.  There be the Greens and the Grays, and they are deadly foes.  They make our lives more difficult still with their vendettas.
24: What is the nature of their feud?
25: Which cause is just?
26: And are they the only inhabitants aside from thee?
27: None can say.  Their conflict seems to have begun at the time of the Great Collapse, when the civilization of the under-earth fell.  We know only that their leaders have sworn never to agree on anything.
28: Is there nothing else thou canst tell me?
29: I thank thee.  Thou hast helped me greatly.
30: And is there aught beyond the domain of these Goblins?
31: Thou again?  Haven't had enough of thy betters, then?

35: Good day to thee again, if day it is outside!
36: Hast thou news of the girl I seek?
37: And a good day to thee.  I must journey onward in my search.
38: Since thou art so kind, I shall take thee up on thy generous offer of absence.  Goodbye!
39: No, she's long gone.  Thou shouldst hurry if thou dost wish to catch her.
40: Surely thou art one among us who was condemned by that pious oaf Baron Almric.  We of the Outcasts are the survivors of his intemperate justice, fugitives from the predations of the Gobs.
41: Ah, perhaps then thou canst tell me of his daughter.
42: What are these Gobs of whom thou doth speak?
43: I shall be on my way.
44: Ah... None who have ventured past the realm of the Gobs have returned.  But rumor hath it there are worse perils below.
45: Well, I thank thee anyway.  Farewell.
46: Perhaps I can solve the mystery for thee.
47: You cowards!  Have none of you the courage to venture down yourselves?
48: Some goblins no longer abide the commands of their leaders, but wander the corridors in search of prey.  They take from our supplies of food and are a danger as well.  Would that we were rid of them.
49: I shall be on the lookout for them.  Farewell.
50: I make thee this offer.
51: I demand thou givest me these items.
52: Excuse me, I must think about this deal.

6: I am Gulik, called the Blessed.
7: Why art thou called that?
8: Art thou the leader here?

10: Our leader is Hagbard.  Hast thou spoken to him?
11: No.  Should I?
12: Why?
13: Yes.
14: I did not hear thee talk with Hagbard!  Why dost thou lie?  Art thou a spy for Ketchaval?
15: Who is Ketchaval?
16: No! I am no spy.
17: Yes, indeed I am!
18: Excuse me, I must be going.
19: Not even a Gray spy would pretend such ignorance!  Ketchaval is the King of the Gray Goblins.  Therefore, if thou art a spy, thou must be from Vernix of the Greens!
20: I am no spy!
21: Yes!  It is all true!
22: Excuse me, I must be going.
23: Thou art in the Great Stygian Abyss, where neither thou nor any other may ever hope to leave again.  'Tis worse than any prison, for there is no hope of parole or pardon, and no death so clean as an honest hanging.
24: Tell me more of this Abyss.
25: How didst thou come to be here?
26: Have none ever escaped?
27: Greetings, @GS8!  Hast thou spoken with Hagbard?
28: Hello again, stranger.  Hast spoken to our leader?
29: Who is he again?
30: Yes.
31: No.
32: Do so!
33: I have been called 'the Blessed' since my prison days, when I was considered lucky because I have a taste for cockroaches.  I never went hungry, thou seest.
34: How very nice for thee... I must be going.
35: And is this place better than a prison?
36: That's repulsive!
37: Then thou shouldst speak with Hagbard.  He is our leader.
38: Perhaps I will.
39: I will seek him out.
40: I have better things to do with my time.
41: Greetings!  What may I do for thee?
42: I thank thee, but I must be going.
43: What didst thou say thy name was?
44: Know ye anything of what lies below?
45: How can one find useful items?
46: Ah, I remember.  He was talking to thee earlier!  Well, may I help thee?
47: I thank thee, but I must be going.
48: What didst thou say thy name was?
49: Know ye anything of what lies below?
50: How can one find useful items?
51: Thou needs must speak with Hagbard.  He alone, of all of us, retains his sanity amidst the madness of this place.
52: Very well.  I shall seek him out.
53: Before I do, what IS this place?
54: It was not always such.  Once, a leader name Sir Cabirus (curst be his name!) had the foolish notion that this place could be colonized.\n When his folly caught up with him, the "civilization" of the under-earth fell, and we now scrabble to survive in its ruins. \n He died, and so escaped the punishment for his crime.  Dreamers!  They will be the death of us all!
55: And thyself? How camest thou here?
56: Perhaps he was merely an idealist.
57: I killed a man who needed killing.  My crime was being caught.
58: Perhaps thou wouldst find peace if thou didst repent.
59: Well, I must be going.  Fare thee well.
60: Escape!  Ha!  There be no escape from this place, barring the Final Escape of death. When the colony fell, a mighty spell was laid on the Great Gate.  Now it cannot be opened save from the outside.
61: Perhaps I know a way.
62: 'Tis a great misfortune, surely.  I sympathize with thee.
63: And perhaps thou art a fool!  Good day to thee!
64: Good day.
65: We shall see.
66: Below us now?  Why, the flaming heart of the volcano, I would surmise.  And below that lie the bowels of Britannia.  Think, friend, someday thou wilt be part of that, and not another  body thrashing about in these caverns we call home.
67: I see.  Goodbye!
68: Ah, thou shouldst know that it is often easier to find useful items by bartering than simply by scavenging.  Find thyself someone who is willing to trade, and give him the items thou dost not need in exchange for more useful ones.\m
69: Keep in mind whom thou art dealing with.  I hear that the Mountainfolk are fond of gold, for example, while Goblins may not be as attached to it.

He just gave me this ring, "A hole of gold," he says to me, "with a plug of fair flesh."\n An' then one o' them headless creatures came runnin' in, and brave Tom WOULD fight wi' it.

But nary one will stay and watch wi' me for my Tom.

1: So!  Another young fool opens a door thoughtlessly.  Open, close, open, close, that's all that anyone ever has the time for.  Things were not like this when I was thy age, I can assure thee of that!  Well?  Hast thou anything to say for thyself?
2: I'm sorry to disturb thee.  I'll leave now.
3: Excuse me... art thou really a door?
4: I mean to open thee, not to talk with thee!
5: Perhaps if thou wert more civil, thou couldst open more doors!
6: Thou again!  What dost thou want this time!
7: Hmmph!  Perhaps the next time thou wilt show greater civilty to thy elders!
8: Bah!  Such disrepect!  I will open when I wish to open!
9: What do I look like, a drawbridge?
10: In fact, thou bearest a remarkable resemblance to one.
11: Thy point is made.  How didst thou come to be a door?
12: I once was a young human like thyself.  But I grew weary of the regular folk and their immense stupidity.  I was a brilliant mage, and was constantly pestered with silly questions, such as "How does one cast Sheet Lightning?"\n Tiring of being hounded thus, I turned myself into a door in order to finally enjoy some peace and quiet.  Obviously, it didn't work.
13: Now that thou dost mention it, how does one cast Sheet Lightning?
14: Canst thou not turn thyself back into a human?
15: Gaaah!  I cannot believe thou wouldst ask that, of all questions!  I should have known better than to mention that accursed spell.\n If thou must know, it is cast by using the Vas, Ort and Grav runestones.  There.  I hope that thou blowest thyself up with it.
16: Thank thee kindly, wise door.
17: At last!  Now my power is increased even more!
18: Art thou implying that my power is not great enough to turn myself into whatever I want?  If I wanted to, I could turn myself into a nutcracker and thee into a walnut!  Wouldst thou like that?
19: Surely not.
20: I'd like to see thee try!
21: Well then, didst thou attempt to open me for a reason, or simply because my doorknob was a bright shiny object?
22: Thou didst mention a Sheet Lightning spell..
23: I wish to pass through to thy other side.
24: No, I'm sorry to have disturbed thee.
25: Very well, if it means that thou wilt not bother me again.
26: Unfortunately, my hinges seem to be somewhat rusty.
27: Couldst thou please open for me?
28: I forget how to cast Sheet Lightning.
29: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother thee.
30: Canst thou tell me of thy history?
31: Couldst thou please open for me?
32: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother thee.
33: Canst thou teach me the Sheet Lightning spell of which thou spoke?
34: Couldst thou please open for me?
35: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother thee.
36: I refuse to help thee with that any more!
37: Again!?  For the last time, the spell is cast by using the Vas, Ort, and Grav runestones.  I don't know why I'm bothering to tell thee. Thou obviously hast not the intelligence necessary to cast it.
38: I make thee this offer.
39: I demand thou givest me these items.
40: Excuse me, I must think about this deal.
41: I do not wish to barter any further.
42: Farewell.
43: I accept thy offer.
44: No, I do not like this deal.
45: Dost thou take me for a fool?
46: I am weary of this haggling.

49: Yes, I must.

3: Good day to thee, my young @SS1.  I am Celaven, and I seek a certain wand.  Hast thou seen it?
4: What sort of wand was this?
5: Yes, I believe I have it here.
6: I have seen no wands.
7: It had the property of casting fireballs.  One of my better works, actually.  I particularly like the way the fireballs look.  Not enough mages take pride in the little details like that.  Then I loaned it to a friend of\n mine, and I think she must have blown herself up with it.  A pity, thou knowst, but there thou art.  Perhaps I should have made sure she knew which end to hold.  At any rate, it has been missing since.  Hast thou seen it?
8: Yes, I believe this is it.
9: I have seen no such wand.
10: A pity.  I felt sure an explorer such as thyself might have run across it. It could be dangerous in the wrong hands, thou knowest.  Art certain thou hast seen it not?
11: Well, come to think of it, I do have a wand here.  Could this be thine?
12: Absolutely.  I would remember such an item.
13: man
14: lady
15: Good day to thee then, my young @SS1.  If thou shouldst encounter my wand, I'll gladly reward thee for its return.
16: Of course.
17: We shall see.
18: Ah, at last!  May I examine it please?
19: Certainly, here you are.
20: Is it yours, or isn't it?
21: Ah.  Now this IS nice.  Very nice indeed.  'Tis not my mine, though.  Unless I'm mistaken, this is the work of Corey Confundo, a most excellent mage indeed.  Thou shouldst consider thyself lucky to have such a tool.  May it serve thee well.
22: Will thou not accept it in place of the one thou lost?
23: Thank thee kindly. I hope thou findest thy wand.
24: Goodbye.
25: Ah, we meet again.  Hast news of my wand?
26: What sort of wand was this again?
27: Is this it?
28: I have seen it not.
29: Well, thou need not be so snappy!  Just hold it up there, that's it.  No, I'm afraid mine is much nicer than that.  Should expect that one might blow off thine hand.  Well, if thou wilt excuse me, I must be going.
30: Fare thee well. I hope thou findest thy wand.
31: Goodbye.
32: Nay, thou art too generous.  My interest is not in any wand, but the one I myself created.  Still, such generosity must be rewarded.  Thou might not know it, but the wand thou hast posseses another setting. . . There.  I think thou shalt find it all the better now.  Good day to thee.

1: Thou hast done well.  And now that my bones are at last at rest I can speak freely to thee.  But my spirit cannot rest while yet this peril remains.\n We must open a gate, near where the foul creature my brother summoned lies bound. We must return it to the plane from whence it came.
2: Is there no other way?
3: How can we open such a gate?
4: No other power can defeat it.  Even banishing it to another place will do it no harm -- may in fact restore to it its full power, if that place be like to its own -- but it will at least remove the threat to Britannia!
5: How can this be done?
6: For this I will need a great deal of magical energy. This will be no gentle luring such as brought thee here, but an unimaginable vortex of interplanar energy.
7: Might Tyball's Orb have sufficed, had it not been destroyed?
8: Where can we find such powerful magic?
9: Tyball's Orb would be perilous to use, even if it were intact.  The power we tap must be carefully chosen...  As thou may have guessed, I am a little out of touch with thy world.  I had hoped thou might provide an answer.
10: I'm afraid I have no idea.
11: What be the qualifications for what thou needest?
12: It would be best if the source were absolutely pure -- my brother found the danger in tapping powers whose source thou knowest not -- and 'twould be best if Britannia herself were somehow involved.
13: How dost thou mean, "Britannia involved?"
14: The source must be pure?
15: 'Twould help to invoke one of the Elements.  We work for Britannia's succor, and we must hope she would lend what aid she could.
16: The Elements?
17: Thou speakest as though Britannia is alive.
18: But the source of the magic must be pure?
19: The classical four: earth, air, fire, and water.
20: Indeed she is, a green and living entity.  Not conscious as we know it, but perhaps aware that we work to her ends.
21: Yes, the source, which, if we are fortunate, may even wake Britannia to our aid, should be as pure as possible.  Else we risk ending like my brother.
22: My mind is a blank.
23: Other...
24: Talismans
25: Talisman
26: No, that will not do.  Perhaps something else...
27: Perhaps thou shouldst ponder the problem for a bit longer.  But think carefully and quickly, for the fate of Britannia is at stake!
28: Perhaps some item or items imbued with Virtue might be of use, if any exist.  Dost thou know of any such items?
29: Yes, of course!  Those would do admirably.  Now, we must find a means to unleash their stored Virtue.  We must find some latent source of power that can be released by applying the energy of the Talismans.
30: I cannot think of anything appropriate.
31: Other...
32: volcano
33: lava
34: No, we need a great source of power that might easily be released.
35: Well, I hope that thou art able to solve the problem quickly, for the fate of Britannia itself hangs in the balance!
36: Perhaps some natural landmark that contains the ability to release great power will do the trick.
37: Yes, of course!  If all eight Talismans be thrust into the volcano's maw, one at a time, I could ride the wave of such power to open the vortex. Ah, thou art wise as well as valorous!  Wilt thou make such a sacrifice?
38: Think again, ghost.  Thou knowest not the troubles I went through to obtain those!
39: Aye, though it pains me sorely to lose such tools as these.
40: But thou must!  Thy sacrifice shall save all of this world!  Surely thou cannot place thine own travails and successes against such a stake as that!
41: Very well, thou art correct.  I shall do it!
42: I shall think on it.
43: Excellent!  Make haste to the lowest place, where thou must cast all eight into the Abyss -- hold back not one, upon thy peril!  When they are consumed by earth's own fire, I shall leash the torrent to gape wide my gate.  With Fortune's smile, we shall send our foe screeching back to its Hell!
44: Where can I find a way into the volcano?
45: Very well!  Look for me there!
46: The Chamber of Virtue is located on the lowest level of the Abyss.  It lies at the very center of the volcano, where the energy fields of the Stygian are their strongest.  'Tis said that a special three-part key is needed to enter, but I know not the veracity of this legend.
47: I will make my way there.
48: Hurry!  There is little time to lose!
49: Hurry, @GS8, there is no time to lose!  Thou must cast all eight of Cabirus' Talismans into the volcano on the lowest level of the Abyss.  Do not fail in thy quest!
50: Yes?  Hast thou discovered a source of energy with which the power of Cabirus' Talismans can be released?
51: Yes?  Hast thou thought of a pure source of power and virtue which may provide me with the requisite amount of magical energy?

7: Exploring, eh?  Ha, that's a good one.  But if thou dost not wish to speak of thy crime, 'tis not my business to ask.\m
8: Ah, a rescue mission, is it?  Should the Baron's guards not be with thee, to aid thee in thy search?  More likely one of them threw thee in here, eh?\m
9: Ah, unjustly imprisoned, art thou?  'Tis the usual story, my @SS1, but that is not to say it may not be true in thy case, I suppose.\m
10: Thou needst not be ashamed of thy misfortune, @SS1; thou art in the same pot with all of us now.  If thou art to have a chance of surviving in the Abyss for long, thou must learn the lay of the land.
11: Indeed, I would be eager to learn of this area.
12: I will be able to manage by myself.
13: Perhaps thou wilt.  I have heard many say the same as thee, and a few are still alive today.
14: Well, what useful information dost thou have?
15: Farewell, then.
16: First off, I would suggest picking up anything thou dost find that seems of use.  Items here are scarce enough - thou wouldst be well advised to take what thou can.\n Scavenge all you want, but stealing is ill-advised. Most of the Abyss' inhabitants guard jealously the few possessions that they have.\n Battlesites are the best for scavenging. That's why I'm here - A battle took place here not long ago - a battle between the Goblins and the above-worlders.
17: What inhabitants are there?
18: What was the cause of this battle?
19: I do not know.  It is rare that the Baron sends his men into the Abyss.  It must have been important.  Though, by the looks of it, the Goblins defeated them handily.\m
20: The Goblins control most of these upper caves.  Two races there are, the Green and the Gray.  If they do not destroy each other, it is not for lack of trying.\n Be thou especially careful of the Gray Goblins.  I was recently imprisoned by them for trespassing.
21: It must have been awful!
22: How didst thou escape?
23: My prison cell was evidently a converted storeroom, for it had a stock of useful items, including a long pole.  Using the pole, I was able to reach a button which opened the door to my cell.  I sneaked away and returned to my people.  I do not think I will venture there again.
24: And what of the other inhabitants of the Abyss?
25: Tell me of thy people.
26: The humans, like thee and myself, have staked out a small area in which we live in relative peace.  Below us are the Mountainmen, and after that I do not know.
27: Where is this enclave of humans?
28: Are all races but ours hostile?
29: A nasty place this is, thou canst be certain of that.  In the parts of the upper caves, uninhabited by Goblins, there are giant spiders and worms.  Our small group is one of the few devoted to peace.\m
30: Thou canst find my people by going west from the entrance to the Abyss, and then north. There is a small chasm to jump over, but thou dost seem to be a dextrous @SS1.  Past the chasm is the sign of civilization everywhere throughout the Abyss: the Banner of Cabirus, marked with an ankh, the sign of the Avatar.\n Outside of areas marked with the Banner, thou shouldst watch thyself most carefully.  Most creatures who do not respect Cabirus' legacy are not particularly friendly.
31: Perhaps I will seek this area out.
32: I thank thee for thy help.
33: Good luck in thy travels.
34: Greetings again!  I am glad to see that thou hast lived this long. It is not easy for one to survive in the Abyss without the help of others.
35: It is easy for me.  I have no need of thy help.
36: Well then, what helpful information canst thou tell me?
37: Greetings!  Hast thou visited our group?
38: Nay, I have not had the time.
39: I have not been able to find it.
40: Yes, I have.
41: Well, 'tis thy decision.  I am sure they would welcome thee.
42: Go west from the entrance chamber, past a door, and then north over a chasm. Remember, the Banner of Cabirus -- with the mark of the ankh on it -- is the mark of civilization in the Abyss.
43: I am glad to hear it.  If thou growest weary of thy travels, thou art welcome to stay with us.
44: I thank thee kindly.

5: Aye, so all of ye say.  Well, it's not me place to cast judgment upon ye.  Behave yourself properly when dealing with the Mountainfolk, that's all we ask.  What else ye do is your own business.  Now, what is it that ye be wanting?
6: Aye, I heard of such a thing.  The Abyss isn't a safe place these days, I tell ye.  Perhaps some other of the Folk might know more about that.  Is there anything else I can help ye with?
7: Is that so?  Well, the Abyss is nae a place to be searching for fortune. Just a shadow of itself, it is nowadays.  Yet of all the Abyss, we be the ones who still know what fortune is and what to do with it.  Goldthirst, our king, has a hoard to rival any in all of Britannia.\n Now, is there anything I can do for ye?
8: Hast thou news of a kidnapped girl?
9: I would like to trade items with thee.
10: Canst thou let me through this portcullis?
11: That is all.  Well met, and farewell.
12: Very well, ye seem a reasonable sort.  Just mind your manners and ye'll nae have trouble with the Folk.  Now, before ye meet the rest of the clan, is there anything else ye'll be wanting?
13: Very well, let's see what ye've found in your adventures.
14: Farewell.
15: A hearty greetings to ye - it is good to meet again.  What can I do for ye now?
16: I make thee this offer.
17: I demand thou givest me these items.
18: Excuse me, I must think about this deal.

2: Ach, ye don't look like a miner to me.  Who be ye?
3: I am @GS8, an adventurer.
4: That is my business, not thine.
5: Well then, off with thee!
6: Well met, @GS8.  I be Hewstone.  What are ye doing in these parts?
7: I wish to learn the ways of a miner.
8: I am looking for treasure.
9: I am searching for a monster to destroy.
10: Aye, ye would be a miner, eh?  It's a tough job, ye should know that. Don't take it up if ye have not the strength.  Hard it work it is, picking up a rock hammer and smashing boulders to pieces, scraping the rock over and over again, one inch of wall at a time.
11: It sounds awful.
12: There must be some good points to being a miner.
13: Well, it is backbreaking work but the rewards are great.  Gold there is for the hard worker, and I know of no substance better.  Ah, the thrill of feeling one's hammer thud solid rock and suddenly discovering a new vein!\n Go ye to the northern part of these mines and see for yourself the beauty of a gold mine.  But watch yourself - a fearsome monster has been seen in that area, and perhaps even an adventurer such as ye could not handle it.\m
14: Is there anything else I can help ye with?
15: Ach, ye've come to the right place.  There is no treasure better than gold, and gold there is in abundance in these mines.  In the north parts of these mines especially, ye shall find a beautiful sight. Be careful of the monster that's been seen around those parts, though.\n Now, what else might ye want to know?
16: The monster of the mines?  A great boon it would be if ye did defeat it, but I don't know that it can be done.  A fearsome thing it is.  Caught it once out of the corner of me eye, and I don't care to see it again.  It lurks in the north part of these mines.  Ye be careful, if ye truly mean to destroy it.\n We caused a cave-in to block its area from ours, so ye'll have to break your way through it.  Is there anything I can help ye with before ye go off after it?
17: What is it like to a be miner?
18: Is there great treasure in these mines?
19: What of the monster that resides here?
20: I would like to trade with thee.
21: Thank thee, I shall be on my way.
22: Decided to be a bit more friendly, eh?
23: Yes.  My name is @GS8.
24: What gave thee that impression?  Goodbye.
25: Good riddance!

2: I have thy blueprints right here.
3: What art thou talking about?
4: If thou hast lost something, perhaps I can retrieve it.
5: For sure ye're not me blueprints, then!  Never uttered a word, did they, and yet ye've a tongue for sure.  Dumb they were, mute as the rock I hewed with their aid, but still I miss them sorely.  Perhaps ye can find them for me?
6: I can try.
7: Why should I find them for thee?
8: lad
9: lass
10: Find me blueprints?  Ach, that would be a good deed indeed!  Somewhere about they are - in the storeroom most likely.  The southeast of my complex, methinks - or is that where the storeroom is?  Here, I'll give ye a set of blueprints of the area so that ye can find your way about...\p Ach!  My blueprints!  Where'd they go?  Ye seem to be a fine @SS18 - perhaps ye can find them for me?
11: I would be happy to.
12: Perhaps.
13: A right good @SS18 ye are.  In the storeroom I think the blueprints are. But ye cannot fly, can ye?  Ach, that's a problem, the storeroom is high up. There's a flying potion somewhere... in the spiral room?  Ach, but that's locked...  The trouble ye put me through, I don't know why I'm helping ye.
14: But it is I that am helping thee.
15: Thy help is much appreciated.
16: Ach, speaking of help, ye could help an old man greatly by finding me blueprints, if ye could.  Now where was the key to the door to the spiral room? In the golden maze room, methinks.  Ach, yes, it's the golden path ye must follow, or else ye may be poisoned... no, that's the poison potion in the spiral room.  Or was it a flying potion?  Maybe both potions - ach, that's it!
17: But which potion is which?
18: There is more than one potion there?
19: Wait, don't rush me... one potion is green, and the other red.  Or is one red and the other green?  Yes, that's it.  One red and one green, no doubt of it. One of the two is a flying potion and one is poison... or is it the other way around?  Ach, now I've forgotten again.  Oh, that's it - green is good.  Or was it red is rotten?\m
20: Well, do your best, won't ye?  And while ye're in the area, if ye happen by me blueprints, bring them back here.  I think I may have left them in the storeroom.  Feel free to help yourself to anything else ye find, though.
21: I'll do my best.
22: We will see.
23: I will follow thy directions as best I can.
24: Ach, I recognize ye!  Ye're my blueprints!  No... maybe ye're my tools? My potion?  I know I've seen ye somewhere!
25: I have retrieved thy blueprints.
26: I cannot find thy blueprints.
27: Maybe these are your blueprints, but they are not mine!
28: Here are thy blueprints.
29: I have not thy blueprints.
30: Cruel ye are, to toy with an old man thus!
31: Where can I find thy blueprints?
32: My blueprints!  At last we are reunited!
33: Here, take another flying potion as a measure of my gratitude. Or perhaps it's a green potion... never ye mind, I'm sure it will do something useful.  I bet ye've never seen a flying potion before, so ye be careful with it.
34: \mWhat, no arms ye have?  I'll leave it here for ye.
35: Thank thee.
36: Farewell.
37: Ach, 'tis my blueprints again!  'Tis right good too see ye again.  Ach, but I've no time for chitchat.  I'm afraid I misplaced my helmet and I must look for it.  This sort of thing didn't happen back when that young boy Cabirus ruled the Abyss, I tell ye.  He had a head on his shoulders.  But he's here no longer, pity.  Now where'd I put my helmet?
38: Farewell.
39: It was nice to chat with thee.
40: Thy helmet is on top of thy head.
41: Ach, so it is, so it is!  A right helpful set of blueprints ye are.  Thank ye kindly, son.

2: I have been unjustly accused of a kidnapping.
3: I am attemping to rescue a girl.
4: I'd rather not speak of it.
5: Survival alone is an ambitious goal in the Abyss.   Thou art a brave soul indeed if thou aspirest to aught beyond that.
6: In sooth, I grow weak already from hunger.
7: My honor demands I pursue my quest against all opposition.
8: True, yet perhaps thou might assist me in my task.
9: I may succumb to hunger ere long.
10: Tell me more of the perils that lie ahead.
11: I must prove my innocence at any cost.
12: Yet, with thy aid, my chances might improve.
13: How dost thou survive amidst such peril?
14: Canst tell me aught of what lies ahead?
15: I will brook no opposition in my quest.
16: Canst thou aid in me in my quest?
17: By the bright and glittering stars of heaven, which I have not seen these many years, I wish I had food to give thee.  Yet, I do not.\n I can, however, tell thee something which, as the ancient proverb  states, may feed thee for life.  Mind thee, many have been cast into the Abyss with the empty promises of the hypocrite Almric, and met with a far more grisly demise than mere starvation.\m
18: Still, my words are as useless as shouting upwind in a hurricane. More to the point, thou mayest find a pond but a little north of here, where fish will leap from the water  and onto thy pole, more numerous than vultures upon a carcass the  jackals have forsaken.
19: If thou dost employ the pole I gave thee, thou shall have all the fish thou may desire.
20: I have an extra pole, if thou dost need one.
21: I thank thee heartily for thy generosity.
22: Thou art kind, but I need it not.
23: I wish thee well.  I once believed in noble causes myself. Now I find that just surviving is a noble enough fight. 'Tis easier to drink water from a sieve than escape from the Abyss alive.  If thou dost seek trouble, it shall  find thee 'ere long.
24: Farewell, and fortune favor thee.
25: I cannot shun the call of duty.
26: I have little urge to seek trouble.  I have outlived many in the Abyss by having the good sense to keep myself out of harm's way.  Thou wouldst be wise to do the same.
27: Canst thou tell me anything that might aid me in my quest?
28: I shall seek advice from one who lives more honorably.  Good day.
29: 'Tis said that against hunger the gods themselves contend in  vain.  Still, Britannia was not built in a day.  I can tell thee this much, at least: To the north but a short way is a pond, as full of fish as the day is long.
30: If thou but put the pole I gave thee to its proper use, thou shalt have fish aplenty.
31: 'Sblood, that is sage advice, friend.  I will go at once.
32: I fear fish do not agree with my stomach.  Goodbye.
33: I have an extra fishing pole.  Dost thou want it?
34: Thank thee.  I gladly accept thy pole.
35: 'Tis a kind offer, but I have no need of it.
36: I fear I can tell thee little of what lies ahead.  I have found  that those seeking trouble in the nether regions of the Abyss find it eager to make their acquaintance.
37: How dost thou survive here, if thou liv'st in fear of thy own shadow?
38: Surely thou knowest of thy immediate surroundings?
39: Hast thou seen an evil wizard carrying a maiden?
40: I take care to keep myself far from trouble's path, and fish for my food.
41: Where dost thou fish in this place?
42: I have more pressing matters to attend to.
43: Hast thou seen an evil wizard carrying a maiden?
44: If thou but venture northward, thou shalt soon come across a pond so thick with fish thou couldst walk across without getting thy boots wet.
45: Use the pole there, and thou shalt soon have food in abundance.
46: I shall.  Thank thee.
47: Perhaps I shall later.
48: I can give thee my spare fishing pole, if thou dost need it.
49: I do need one.  Thank thee kindly.

64: Never mind that. Dost thou know aught of an evil wizard nearby?
65: Welcome back!  In sooth, thou art lucky to have survived so long, friend.  The Abyss is a place of fearsome peril.
66: I am an outcast, trying to survive amidst the fearsome perils of the Abyss. I am surprised thou hast lived so long in spite of thy surly disposition.

1: Hail, stranger.  `Tis indeed a rare pleasure to encounter a new face amongst the denizens of the Abyss.  What hast brought thee hither?
2: I must prove I am innocent of a kidnapping.
3: I'd rather not dwell on it.
4: Suit thyself, friend.  `Tis thy business, not mine.
5: A terrible crime, indeed.  I would fain believe thou art innocent of such, for thy face has honor in it. Thou dost wear it like few I have beheld in my many years in the Abyss.  May I help thee in any way?
6: Why art thou here?
7: Hast thou heard aught of a princess?
8: Canst thou tell me aught of this region of the Abyss?
9: Like thee, I was unjustly accused of killing a man.  I swear to thee I never struck him.  I merely held him down whilst my brother kicked him.  He should not have treated our sister as he did.  And only a weak man could perish from such slight injuries.
10: Methinks thou art guilty as an accomplice.
11: Indeed, Almric's justice is a blind archer, oft missing the mark.
12: I fear I canst tell thee nothing new.
13: It is said the trolls have captured a new dweller in the Abyss.\m
14: I have heard there is to be a human sacrifice in Cabirus' old quarters on the lowest level.\m
15: A Knight told me that a maiden's body had been found in the lower levels.\m
16: In their search for some new advantage over the trolls, the  Knights explore more widely than I.  Mayhap they can tell thee more.\n Still, be careful, lest thou become the next casualty in their senseless battle with the trolls.
17: It may be the Knights can tell thee something, for they travel more of the Abyss than I.
18: Tell me of these Knights.
19: I have problems enough of my own.
20: There is much tension on this level of the Abyss.  The Knights inhabit the western area, and a pack of Trolls live in the eastern reaches.\n Even while Sir Cabirus was alive, there was an uneasy peace between them.  After Cabirus' death, there was some strife, as each group attempted to gain power over the other, but these days there is relative peace.\m
21: Perhaps the greatest danger in this area now is Rodrick, known as the Chaos Knight.  He lives by the old banquet hall to the north.  He is the foe of both the Knights and the Trolls, but neither has been able to defeat him yet. I hear that Dorna Ironfist has put a price upon his head.
22: Thank thee for thy information.
23: Hast thou heard news of a captive virgin in the Abyss?
24: And methinks thou art a self-righteous ass, who wouldst be  well-suited in the company of the pompous Knights with their overweening morals.  Thy inflated ego wouldst find much company there.
25: In sooth, thou speakest with a wisdom beyond thy years,  friend.  What I wouldst not give to teach that tyrant Almric a lesson about justice and honor!  I would deal him a buffeting that would leave his heirs dizzy for generations to come.\m
26: Would I could aid thee more, friend, but I know little.  I have heard tell that a maiden is held captive near Cabirus's  quarters far below.  Perhaps the Knights could tell thee more.
27: What dost thou know of the Knights?
28: I will take thy advice to heart.
29: Well met, friend.  How dost thou in thy quest?
30: Not well.  Hast thou any news for me?
31: Well.  I must soon head to the lower levels.
32: In sooth, I am sorry to hear thee  pronounce thy own death sentence.  Good luck, for thou wilt need it if you are  to have any hope of surviving below.

37: Wouldst thou be interested in a trade?
38: Yes.
39: No.
40: I make thee this offer.
41: I demand thou givest me these items.
42: I beg thy pardon, I must think about this deal.
43: I do not wish to barter any further.
44: Farewell.
45: Thou hast a deal!
46: Thy offer does not interest me
47: What kind of fool dost thou take me for?
48: I grow weary of this petty haggling.
49: That is no trade!
50: Art thou attempting to intimidate me into surrendering my possessions?
51: Yes, I will deal thee grievous injury if thou dost not comply.
52: No, thou mistakest my meaning entirely.
53: If thou art desperate enough to steal, I will not oppose thee.
54: Miscreant!  I shall teach thee a lesson!

1: I am Derek, a knight and a worker.  Who art thou?
2: My name is @GS8.  I am on a quest.
3: @GS8, an aspiring knight.
4: Ah, the adventurous life is not for me.  I am content to remain here and work at my craft.
5: Perhaps thou art simply a coward.
6: What is thy craft?
7: Despite thy words, many feel that it is more important to contribute to society by one's work than by one's sword.
8: How dost thou contribute to society, then?
9: Perhaps thou art correct.  What is thy work?
10: I have no time for those who are not as valorous as I.
11: I carve gems and work metals.  It is hard and tedious work, especially with poor tools, but I am content with it nonetheless.
12: I wish I could help thee with thy work.
13: Would this item help thee?
14: Not all avocations are equally exciting.
15: Well, if thou hast anything that would help me in my work, I would appreciate it.  Perhaps thou hast collected such an item in thy travels.
16: Will this help?
17: If I do find such an item, I shall let thee know.
18: Ah, that's no ordinary tool, but a true work of art befitting an Avatar!  I can't take it from thee.
19: No, I insist - take it.
20: Very well.
21: That is too kind of thee.  I cannot tell thee how much it will help me in my work.  Thou hast demonstrated much humility by giving away this artifact - it is only right that I tell thee of the Ring of Humility.\m
22: There is a room in the northwest portion of the level below us. There you will find four switches.  Flip them in this order: northwest, southeast, northeast, and southwest.  Be careful to stay out of the middle of the room.
23: Ah, I'm afraid that is of no use to me.
24: I will let thee know if I find something more useful.
25: Perhaps this would help thee more.
26: Greetings, @GS8.  How goes it?
27: I believe I have found an item that may help thee.
28: Satisfactorily.  Now I must continue on my quest.
29: Greetings, @GS8.  I am forever indebted to thee for the gem cutter thou hast given me.  It has increased my productivity tenfold.
30: Don't mention it.
31: I am glad it was of use.

1: I welcome thee to the last bastion of civilization in the Abyss, traveller.
2: Thou dost relieve my fears, for I thought civilization gone.
3: This really isn't much, despite thy claims.
4: I have nothing to say to thee.
5: If that is what thou wishest.
6: Wait! I must speak with thee.
7: Thou hast returned.  What dost thou wish to speak of?
8: Nothing.  Farewell.
9: The order of the Crux Ansata.
10: This taper that was lost.
11: It is good to see thee again.  Thou wilt go down in the history of our order as the brave soul who found the Taper of Sacrifice that was so long lost.  I thank thee again.
12: Our order has been here since the founding of the Colony of the Abyss, and has had many virtuous members.  In the chaos that followed Cabirus' death, we attempted to collect the Talismans of virtue.  However, most were already lost, some supposedly destroyed.\n We did have the Taper of Sacrifice, briefly, but it was taken by some lunatic.  Supposedly the Standard of Honor is somewhere as well, merely awaiting an honorable deed.
13: Tell me about this taper.
14: We had it, but a while ago a lunatic raided our quarters and stole many things.
15: Thank you for the information.
16: It is my pleasure to provide information to a member of the order.
17: The order has been here since the founding of the Colony of the Abyss, and has had many virtuous members.  More I cannot say to one who is not a member, but thou mayst return to me once thou art inducted and I can tell thee more.
18: I shall.
19: I doubt I will bother.
20: Well, thy path is thine alone to choose,  but I feel it should lie with ours for a while.
21: Hast thou heard tell of it, or even seen it, perhaps?
22: Yes, I have heard others speak of it.
23: That is good news.  Continue to search, and thou mayst find it.
24: Yes.  Actually, I have it.
25: No.  Canst thou tell me more of it?
26: The lunatic who took it fled to the levels above, or so it is told.  Perhaps others have heard tell of him, or can otherwise help thee.
27: Farewell.
28: It is in thy possession e'en now?  Could thou please show it to me?
29: Very well, here it is.
30: No.  It would not be appropriate.
31: Please, may I see it?
32: Please reconsider.
33: I beg of thee, let me but look at it.
34: Thou art indeed cruel, to deny me a glance at the Taper of Sacrifice.
35: That is not the Taper.  Return if thou hast truly found it.
36: Ah!  To see the taper again, this is good indeed.
37: Ah!  It is good to be bathed in the taper's radiance once more.
38: I thank thee for the chance to see the taper again. Now that thou hast found it, it is right that thou dost keep it.  Thou wilt find that the light it produces is quite steady, for it continually sacrifices of itself to produce light for thee.\n Cabirus imbued it with virtue, however, and although it consumes itself constantly to provide light, it is continually replenished as well.
39: I shall keep it then, and keep it safe.
40: Good luck to thee.
41: Thank thee.
42: And I thank thee for finding it.
43: What dost thou want?
44: Nothing.  Farewell.
45: Canst thou tell me of Sir Cabirus?  I thought all had abandoned his dream.
46: Thou hast uttered sacrilege.  Recant or face my blade.
47: I must say what I believe.
48: That is as it must be,  as is my slaying thee in the name of my order.
49: Thou art quite right.  This culture is splendid.
50: That is more appropriate. I trust thou wilt remember this lesson.  Leave now.
51: It has been thy misfortune to travel through the other levels of this wasteland, and I am not surprised thou dost think that.  However, we still abide by the dreams of Cabirus and the eight virtues.
52: I thought all had abandoned Cabirus' dream.
53: They seem to be outdated, and to have failed.  Perhaps  you should admit defeat and start something new.
54: No! We work still to bring about a return to the days of the Abyss' glory.  There is hope yet if the races of the colony will  believe again in the virtues and in each other.\n Unfortunately, I think there is little hope.  Most of the dwellers in this colony have forgotten what little they may once have known about its purpose.\m
55: Even the most stalwart believers now doubt.  No one remembers the virtues any more.  It is a sad situation.\n Why, several months  ago, someone came from above and stole one of the greatest treasures remaining from Cabirus' days.
56: That is tragic.
57: Indeed it was.\n
58: What was stolen?
59: We lost many small things, mostly from storage.  All of our torches and lanterns were taken.  A few items of food, but mostly light sources, actually.  Quite odd.\n The grave loss was that of the Taper of Sacrifice, though. It was created by Sir Cabirus  himself and imbued with virtue. We placed it in our shrine where we kept a vigil over it. There it remained lit for three years.\m
60: But one day a man arrived at one of our guard posts. He ranted and raved, but we let him in, as common courtesy dictates, of  course.  He started running about and grabbing candles and such. We were all too shocked to respond.  Then he grabbed the Taper itself and ran off.\n By the time we were in armor and ready to give chase we had lost him. A tragedy it was.
61: Perhaps I shall seek this Taper thou dost speak of.
62: I wish thee good luck.  Seek it above, for that is where we believe the lunatic came from.
63: I believe that I have found this Taper.
64: It must be hard living in a wild place like this.
65: It is indeed tiresome.  But Knights of the Crux are not defeated, regardless of the difficulty of their task.
66: Farewell.
67: I make thee this offer.
68: I demand thou givest me these items.
69: Excuse me, I must think about this deal.
70: I do not wish to barter any further.
71: Farewell.
72: I accept thy offer.
73: No, I do not like this deal.
74: Dost thou take me for a fool?
75: I am weary of this haggling.
76: Surely thou art joking.
77: Dost thou intend to rob me?
78: Yes, I must.

1: Lo fair person.  Here we are in the ruins of what was once a great civilization, ruined by greed, despair, and pain.
2: That sounds horrible.  What happened?
3: Perhaps the people of the Abyss deserved such a fate.
4: Thou art back, outsider from above.  What dost thou think of our settlement here?
5: To be honest, I am not that impressed.
6: It is quite nice.
7: It must have been quite something in the old days.
8: In better times thou wouldst have seen our true glory.  The  splendor of our domain and righteousness of our cause were great indeed.\n But alas, the environs have changed and the walls have fallen down, the just have been silenced by the desperate, and not even the strongest among us can hope to rebuild what Cabirus wrought.
9: What was it like before?
10: Perhaps it should never have been built.
11: It was wonderful.  We would visit the ceremonial hall every day.  Sometimes we would go below and challenge the Golem to a test of might.  There were marvelous banquets. The Mayors of towns throughout Britannia would come to marvel at our achievements. Now none can survive the dangers of this place long enough to reach us.
12: Well, I was able to reach thee.
13: A test of might?
14: What have you done to make it better?
15: Well, thou art an exception, the first outsider I've seen in this place in years.
16: Thou didst speak of a test of might.
17: Have you done anything to improve the area?
18: A Golem resides on an island surrounded by lava in the land of the Seers.\n We would take our swords and shields, leap onto the island, and battle the Golem.  It was indestructable, but honorable and valorious.  Though it could not be destroyed, it would congratulate thee if thou didst fight well.\n If thou wert good enough it would sometimes reward thee.
19: The Seers live below, correct?
20: Yes.  If the Golem still exists, he would be there.
21: Thank thee.
22: We have sent Knights on many quests to make certain things better. All met with grave perils.  Some met with success. Some never returned.
23: I am glad to hear that some of the quests were successful.
24: Tell me about those who never returned.
25: We heard rumors that a powerful mage on the seventh level of the Abyss was kidnapping and killing  people.  We sent a party of our most valorous Knights to investigate. They never returned.  We hope to  mount an expedition to investigate, but our resources are limited.
26: Perhaps this is the same mage I seek.
27: I will investigate this mage myself.
28: Thank thee for thy time, and farewell.
29: Be thou most careful!  If our Knights were unable to defeat him, he must be powerful indeed.
30: Yes, we made great inroads against the trolls at first.  And we nearly succeeded in clearing our own demesne of headlesses and other vermin.  Our recent quests have been disasters, though, and our order is in trouble.
31: What has gone wrong?
32: I would like to join the order if possible.
33: Seek out Dorna Ironfist, our leader, if thou wishest to join.
34: man
35: woman
36: In the old days, thou wouldst not have said that!  No one  understands  the splendor of Cabirus'  achievements...\p Oh, thou wouldst not understand.

1: Welcome, traveller.  How can I help thee?
2: \mThat is all I can tell thee of that particular matter.  What else art thou interested in?
3: I am sorry but I have no more knowledge to impart to thee.  I wish thee good luck in thy quests, whatever they may be and wherever they may take thee.
4: Tell me of the sights of this level.
5: What wouldst thou know?
6: Tell me of the Trolls.
7: How did your order come to the Abyss?
8: I thank thee for thy time.
9: My pleasure.
10: Ah, yes, this area is wonderfully designed.  We created much of it ourselves, with some help from the artisans of Minoc and the Mountainfolk.  There are many regions of interest.  Although the Abyssal colony has only existed a short time, it is filled with wonders to match any found in Britannia.
11: Canst thou tell me of these wonders?
12: It does not seem very wondrous to me.
13: I have just begun to explore its beauty.
14: In the northeast corner of the level is the Puzzle of the Bullfrog, made by a Mountainfolk craftswoman who had a love of frogs.\n To the northwest is the Maze of Silas, a stoneworker and lover of deceptive walls.\n Beyond the maze is the door of precious levers, which opens the gateway to the resting place of one of our order.\n There is a water-filled area to the west of the Abyss' volcanic core. The waterfall is something to see.
15: Tell me about the Puzzle of the Bullfrog.
16: Tell me about the Maze of Silas.
17: Tell me about the door of precious levers.
18: Tell me about the watery area.
19: I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
20: Past the puzzle in the northeast there is an entrance to the tombs below.  To reach the entrance, one must traverse an area surrounded by water.  It is said that by using the levers and buttons in the area, one may create a safe path to the other side.  It has been years since the puzzle was created, though, and its solution is now lost.  The only clue I know of is that the wand found there will restore the puzzle to its pristine state.
21: I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
22: The Maze of Silas is now infested with pests and littered with debris and bones, but there are said to be other things in the maze as well -- hidden chambers and items of some value. The locations of these chambers and items are unknown now, however, so what they contain I cannot reveal to thee.
23: I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
24: Near the volcano's shaft is a set of falls leading to two pools.\n One pool is very hard to reach, at least from our domain. But 'tis said it is simple to get there from the Lair of the Lizard-Folk. Would that one among us could speak their tongue and learn the easier route.\n The second pool is in a secluded spot near a fishing run south of the Abyss' central shaft.
25: I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
26: The puzzle of precious levers is beyond the maze.  Although the members of our knighthood will not be specific, it is believed to be in a concealed area.\n The puzzle itself was built to guard the stores of the old government of the Abyss.  Now, however, not one of us could tell thee what lies beyond the closed door.\m
27: The workings of the levers are not understood, but 'tis said that their secrets can be gleaned through careful examination of the artifacts of our order.\n I have not the patience for such research, but perhaps one who does will solve the mystery.
28: I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
29: They are indeed a vicious and dangerous race.  I would call them indecent, but that was not Cabirus' way, and I strive not to make it mine.\n They are, truth be told, honorable in their own way.  Only a few of them still cling to any shreds of the Abyss' purpose, though.  Some have reverted to their natural, combative state.  They are monsters, and powerful ones, at that.
30: How can one pass through their realm safely?
31: I suppose I should be ready to fight.
32: Ready, yes, but not eager.
33: I can handle them.
34: Part of a knight's goal is to be a good fighter, it is true.  But a good fighter does not rejoice in a battle for its own sake.\n Thy blade is an ally only when it is used with honor and justice. When it is used for needless bloodshed, it stains thy honor and the honor of thy order.\n Do not fight for the sake of killing.  Fight for thy life, the life of those thou art sworn to defend, and to eliminate those that threaten our realm.  Fighting for the sake of blood is a short road to death.
35: Thou needst not fight continually to survive their realm. In the south, where the main meeting hall of the Trolls used to be, there are still Trolls who respect Cabirus' purpose.  They can tell thee more of the realm.  Beware the Dark Trolls - they are more powerful even than the normal ones.\m
36: Also beware the northern parts of their realm, for they have been invaded by spiders, headlesses, and worse.  These monsters will provide enough trouble, so don't attack Trolls unless they attack thee first.  Thou wilt have enough trouble staying alive without picking fights.
37: We came here from Jhelom.  The fairest town in Britannia, that I can say with certainty.  Been to them all I have, and none compare.
38: Thou dost speak truly.
39: It certainly is a fine town.
40: Thou dost think so?  I disagree.
41: The colony of the Abyss was an achievement unparalleled in recent times.  Eight cultures mixing in one environment, and getting along splendidly.  We had some banquets that were spectacular, I tell thee.  They rivaled the best of parties that even Jhelom could offer. We would all gather just to the northeast of here in the banquet hall.  We would stay up all night -- though of course it is hard to tell down here -- and recount tales of our homelands, our rituals, and our friends.\m
42: Now all we do is fight for food and space.  Truly the death of Cabirus was the death of the Colony of the Stygian Abyss.  Still, we try, for it is all we can do to honor his legacy and dream.
43: Perhaps the inhabitants of Jhelom were not perfect, but they were certainly more courteous than thee.
44: Farewell.

46: I demand thou givest me these items.

10: @SS1, Thou art a member of my order.  Thou too dost strive to uphold the ideals of honor espoused by our order.  Thou dost understand the virtues, and understand the ways of knighthood.  Please listen to my tale.
11: Good @SS1, thou dost seem valorous and just, well equipped for the grave peril of the Abyss, and ready to brave the dangers of this area.  Please listen to my tale.
12: I would be happy to hear thy story.
13: 'Tis not a happy story, @SS1, but I shall tell it all the same.\m
14: I shall.  Begin it at once.
15: I am quite busy.  Perhaps some other time.
16: Sir Rodrick was once a member of our order, but abandoned the principles of our order and now calls himself the Chaos Knight, terrorizing the entire northern area.  Since to attack one with many would be dishonorable, our leader Dorna picked me to defeat him in single combat.\m
17: When I reached the old banquet hall to the north, I was suddenly attacked by Rodrick, who leaped from a ledge above me and took me off guard.  He attacked relentlessly, and although I hit him several times, my own blows did little to slow him or curb his apparent anger.  He taunted me continuously as we fought, and would not listen as I attempted to reason with him.\m
18: I am surprised that thou art still alive.
19: How did the battle finally end?
20: After several minutes I was bleeding from several wounds and thinking my time was up.  In desperation, I flung my sword at him.  He blocked it easily, but the distraction allowed me to run from him.\m
21: So that is my story.  I can not return to my home until I have eliminated Rodrick and restored our order's honor, but it will be some time now before I am capable of fighting.  So I wait here, far from the Trolls and other pests, gathering my strength before I head off again.
22: Thou art going to attack him again?
23: Surely thou art mad.
24: My honor is my life, and he has stolen it by defaming our order and defeating me.\m
25: That is wise of thee.
26: I must defeat him to restore my honor and that of my order, it is true, but a true knight approaches battles with strength and wits, and even with my wits it is clear that I am not now ready to fight him.\m
27: Please return, and help me.
28: I am quite disappointed with thy lack of compassion.
29: Sir
30: Lady
31: Noble @SS2, I implore thee to hear it, for it is of great import, and dire consequences arise from it.

33: Very well, but tell it quickly.
34: I'd give the rest of my right arm for a chance to take that rogue on again.  He'd find out what sort of Knight I am.
35: Thou shouldst probably rest.
36: Thou art certainly right.
37: Perhaps I can defeat him.
38: That would be quite honorable of thee.
39: Let us join forces to defeat the villain.
40: I should get well first, for I would not wish to be a burden on thee.
41: If thou dost meet the rogue and defeat him, it would not only bring great honor to thee but also perhaps save my life.
42: I will seek him out.

47: A pleasure to meet thee again, @GS8.  I've no time to talk at the moment, as I must return home to rejoin my companions. I would be most pleased to talk with thee once I am there.

1: Greetings, traveler.  What brings thee to an area of the Abyss as perilous as this?  Art thou upon a quest, as I myself am?
2: What is thy quest?
3: No, I am not on a quest.
4: Many years ago, I began research into methods for turning lower metals into gold.  During the course of my research, I discovered a new and better method that depends on a particular, very rare substance.  I quest to find more of this substance.
5: Why is this method so much better?
6: Tell me of this substance.
7: zanium
8: the principal reagent
9: When I started, existing methods required a great many reagents to operate, and could produce only a fraction of an ounce of gold for each pound of lower metal.\n The new method requires a much smaller quantity of reagents and produces much more gold.  However, @SS1 is rare, and I have been able to locate only trace amounts of it.
10: Tell me of this substance.
11: How is the mineral collected?
12: Tell me of the mining area.
13: Where hast thou located the reagent?
14: It is a blue rock-like mineral called zanium.  The only samples I have found have been on this floor of the Abyss in tunnels with rough-hewn walls.  I believe there is a mining area in the southwest where there may be larger deposits, but I cannot gain access to it.
15: How is the new method better?
16: How is this mineral collected?
17: Tell me of the mining area.
18: Zanium has the property of being self-attractive.  Deposits near the surface can be collected merely by walking over them while carrying a sample.  In an underground environment such as this, if there is zanium present, there is likely to be some near the the surface.  Thus, in a sense, it is collected automatically.
19: Tell me of this mining area.
20: Who might know more about the mine?
21: Then perhaps I can help thee.
22: I do not know much.  There is a small room in the southwestern region that is labelled "mine dispatch chamber."  There appear to be some controls, but I know not how to operate them.
23: Is there anyone who would know about the controls?
24: How is this mineral collected?
25: Now that thou dost mention it, yes, there is one who may know something.  One of those frightful ghouls in the catacombs used to be foreman in the mining sector.  No ghoul has spoken to me since I killed one of them in self-defense.  Perhaps thou couldst assist me?
26: What assistance dost thou need?
27: I am sorry, but I am unable to help thee.
28: If thou couldst talk to the miner ghoul and discover how to operate the dispatch chamber I would be most grateful.  In addition, if thou wouldst enter the mining area, brave its dangers and collect at least eighty samples of zanium, I would reward thee with a large gold nugget created from lead.
29: I shall get thee information about the controls.
30: I will bring thee the zanium.
31: Well, if thou dost change thy mind, speak with me again.  Farewell.
32: Wait!  I will help thee.
33: Farewell.
34: Wouldst thou?  Thou art indeed a kind soul!  Take this small sample.  Carry it through the mine, and it shall attract more of its kind.
35: I will leave it on the floor here for thee.
36: Farewell.
37: I thank thee kindly.  Speak to me after thou hast obtained the pertinent information.  Farewell.
38: Wait, I shall get the zanium.
39: Farewell.
40: I see.  Then thou art an intrepid explorer indeed, to brave such depths as this.
41: Though I have no quest, do tell me of thine.
42: Indeed.  And I must continue.  Farewell.
43: Farewell.
44: Hast thou obtained the information I require?
45: Yes, I have.
46: No, I have not.
47: I have decided to get the zanium.
48: Excellent!  What are the settings for the controls?
49: The settings are...
50: Oh, sorry.  I do not have the settings.
51: 'Tis a shame.  Return when thou hast it.
52: 726
53: I thank thee very much.  I shall attempt to enter the mine.
54: I thank thee for the information.  It was indeed correct, but I was unable to retrieve the zanium because of numerous apparitions in the mine area.  Wouldst thou retrieve it?
55: Yes.
56: No, I cannot.
57: Well, if thou dost reconsider, let me know.
58: The information thou didst give me was incorrect.  Dost thou wish to correct it?
59: Yes, I do.
60: No, I do not.  Farewell.
61: I shall get the zanium.
62: Hast thou found eighty samples of zanium?
63: Yes, I have.
64: No, I have not.
65: Excellent!  May I have them please?
66: Here they are.
67: Oh, sorry.  I don't have them.

79: Please tell me of thy quest.
80: I was just leaving
81: Hast thou reconsidered?  Wilt thou help me after all?
82: Yes.  What dost thou need?

85: Yes, I shall.
86: No.  Farewell.
87: I must thank thee again for retrieving the zanium.  I am sorry, but I must excuse myself, as I am still busy with experiments.
88: I am sorry.  Here are thy eighty samples of zanium.
89: I will go then and retrieve more zanium.

2: Hey, human.  What you do here, far from home?
3: I am travelling the depths of the Abyss.
4: I could ask thee the same question.
5: None of thy business!
6: Should no bother exploring Abyss.  Not much to see now - just people try to survive.  Used to be lot going on, before collapse.
7: What went on here before the collapse?
8: What didst thou do before the collapse?
9: No one lived here, but they come to state chamber, tombs, and mines.  Diplomats and visitors use state chamber for talks, funerals here, too.  Important people buried in tombs.  Me used to work in mines.

12: Me have important job before collapse.  Me operator of mine dispatch chamber.  Only one who know combination for dispatch unit.

16: What is the mine dispatch chamber?
17: How does one use this chamber?

29: Me live here with rest of Ghouls because me no can work any more. Me work before great collapse.
30: What was thy job before the collapse?
31: Why canst thou no longer work?
32: Me used to work in mines.  After collapse, mines no running, so me out of job.
33: What was thy job?
34: Where are the mines?

43: Me no see any fish there!  You got fish?
44: Me only see @GI37 fish!  You got ten?
45: Thanks.  People scarce recently, fish good substitute.

50: Very well, I have some fish.
51: I shall return with fish.
52: Fine.  Farewell.

1: Ho, adventurer!  I have been looking for one like thee.  Hast thou made the acquaintance of an adventurer known as Zak?
2: I have not met such a man.
3: Indeed I have.  He lives above with the lizardmen.
4: Zak?
5: I am sorry to hear it.  I have not been able to find another candelabra like the one he stole from me.
6: I am glad to hear that!  Perhaps I will be able to retrieve my candelabra from him now.
7: I don't know his real name, but he has come to be known simply as Zak.  He was a Knight, I understand, before finding something in his adventures that caused him to lose his sanity.  Recently he wandered by and made off with my candelabra.  I don't expect ever to see it again.  I hear that he also stole from the Knights some candle that they value highly.
8: I've never met him.
9: Indeed I have met him!  He resides above us, on the level of the lizardmen.
10: Hello, @GS8!  I thank thee again for telling me of the whereabouts of Zak.
11: Oh, hello again.  Hast thou perhaps found Zak?
12: No, I still have not seen him.
13: Yes, in fact, I have seen him.  He lives above with the lizardmen.
14: I'm sorry - who is Zak again?

2: Yes, I am.  Canst thou direct me to it?

4: No, I'm not interested in thy Golem.
5: What is this Golem thou dost speak of?
6: Well then, I wish thee luck with whatever else thou searchest for.
7: Thou canst find him by heading west from the central chamber as far as thou canst and then turning left.  He's on the island surrounded by lava.  Be warned - he is quite tough!
8: The Golem was created by the Seer Lerin at the Knights' request as a test of valor.  No Knights have come down to test themselves against him for quite a while now, but they used to frequently.  I believe that a suitable prize awaits the one who can defeat him.
9: I'm sure I can defeat him!
10: He sounds too formidable a foe for me.
11: Congratulations!  Thou art truly as valorous as a Knight.
12: Congratulations again on defeating the Golem.  I hope that thy valor will enable thee to rid the Abyss of whatever foul creatures remain.
13: Greetings!  Hast thou defeated the Golem I told thee of?
14: No, not yet.

18: No, I don't think I can defeat him.

20: I have not been able to find him.
21: He is a better warrior than I.
22: I am afraid that he will kill me.

2: Well, what is thy problem?
3: No, I probably can't.
4: I've lost the ability to levitate, so I can no longer cross lava with ease.  I need to cross some lava, and the only thing that could now help me would be a pair of dragonskin boots.  Canst thou help me?
5: Certainly, here you go.
6: Sorry, I can't help you.
7: I don't know what you're talking about.

2: Yes.
3: No.
4: Who?
5: I am glad to hear it!  He must have told thee the code word he was searching for, then!
6: I'm afraid not.
7: Indeed he did.
8: I may have been mistaken.  Perhaps I did not meet this Gurstang.
9: That seems quite unlikely.  Perhaps thou mistook another mage for my friend Gurstang.  If thou truly findest Gurstang, please   let me know!
10: Yes?  And what was it?
11: Other...
12: I don't think I should tell thee.
13: I may be able to help thee if thou tellst me the word.
14: Well then, it was...
15: Nay, I will not tell it to thee.
16: Hmm.  I begin to think that perhaps thou hast not met Gurstang after all.  I hope that thou wilt tell me the word he gives thee if thou dost see him.
17: Folanae
18: Hmm... @PS-2, thou sayest.  No, that doesn't seem quite right.  Art thou quite sure that was the word?
19: Maybe not.  Perhaps the word was...
20: I thought it was.
21: I may be mistaken.
22: I would suggest that thou dost find Gurstang again and make sure of the code word this time.
23: Hmm... Folanae, thou sayest...\p perhaps...\p Yes, that must be it! The puzzle is becoming clearer!
24: What puzzle?
25: That's great.  Now, I must be going.
26: Gurstang was searching for clues to the Key of Truth, a fabled object which has long been lost.  Apparently, it is no longer in this world, so Gurstang and I looked for possible ways to bring it here from whatever world it is now in.  The word that Gurstang found is an important clue.
27: What is its meaning?
28: We were of the opinion that praying at a shrine might bring it back.  I would guess that the library might contain information regarding which shrine must be used.  I suspect that any tome mentioning Gurstang's word, "Folanae," would hold the final clue to regaining the key.
29: I will seek out this information.
30: Good luck!
31: Where is this library?
32: It is located in the old Academy, in the northwest.  Enter the Academy's main hall and head west; it should be on thy left. Good luck!
33: That's too bad.  I wonder what happened to him.  I hope that he has not been killed, or worse!
34: My friend Gurstang, a fellow Seer.  He went downstairs a few months ago and I haven't seen him since.
35: Oh, that Gurstang!  I just ran into him.
36: That's terrible!  I haven't seen him.
37: What was he doing down there?
38: He was on a search for the fabled Key of Truth.  He must have fallen into the hands of Tyball, the wizard below.
39: I believe I have seen him.
40: I shall let thee know if I find him.
41: Please do.  I fear for his safety.
42: Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found the Key of Truth?
43: Yes, I have found it.
44: Not yet.
45: Canst thou repeat what thou said earlier of it?
46: Hello, @GS8!  Art thou not interested to learn the significance of the word Gurstang gave thee?
47: Yes, please tell me.
48: Not particularly.
49: Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found my friend Gurstang?
50: Yes, I have discovered him.
51: I'm afraid not.
52: I knew it could be found!  I hope that the Key aids thee in thy quest.
53: I wish thee luck and speed in finding it.
54: Thank thee, I will continue on my quest to find it.
55: How didst thou say it could be found?
56: I think that praying at a shrine must have something to do with it.  I would look in the library for a book that contains "Folanae," the word that Gurstang discovered, for a clue.
57: I will look there.  Thank thee!
58: Where is this library again?
59: Congratulations on finding the Key of Truth!  I hope that it will prove an aid to thee.

6: I certainly could use a Vas runestone!
7: Well then, here's how to obtain one.
8: Well, listen carefully, for I shall tell thee how to obtain a Vas runestone, the most powerful runestone there is.
9: Go to the meeting hall to the east and shoot right between the eyes.  Then put an emerald on each of the four platforms in the corners, walk back to the middle of the room, and press the gray button.
10: Thank thee, I shall follow thy instructions carefully.
11: Thy instructions are most confusing.
12: 'Tis true - they are.  'Tis also true that if thou canst not follow them, thou art perhaps not worthy to reap the reward gained by doing so.  Good luck.

5: That is too bad, for it has been closed for years now.
6: 'Twould not matter in any case, for the Academy has been closed for many a year.
7: I am not surprised, for the Academy is now closed, and few remember its days of glory.
8: 'Tis a pity that thou wert not here when Sir Cabirus was still alive.  The Abyss was a thriving settlement, and our Academy was the center of it.  Nobody seems to be interested in the higher arts any longer, though.
9: Indeed, simply to survive here is quite a feat.
10: But I am!  Canst thou assist me in my search for knowledge?
11: This is so.  Since the Academy was closed, most of us have been content merely to eke out a meager existence in some small corner of the Abyss.
12: And the Academy?  Is there aught left of it now?
13: I do not blame thee.  The Abyss is truly a dangerous place.
14: I am afraid our once proud Academy has been infested by creatures who have no interest in the knowledge and wisdom contained there. To them, its halls offer notihg more than convenient shelter.  It pains my heart to think of the Academy's decline from the days of old.
15: What knowledge may one find in the Academy?
16: I sympathize with thee.  Surely 'twas once a wondrous place.
17: Perhaps one day the Abyss will return to its former glory, but I begin to doubt it more and more.  Ah, what I would not give to see the Academy restored!

17: And where is he now?
18: Whether he be alive or dead, I know not.  He took over the caves to the northeast, filling them with vicious creatures and devious traps.  No sane person ventures there any longer, least of all myself.  Wilt thou run an errand there for me?
19: Assuredly.  I have no fear of this Vilus.
20: Not if it as dangerous as thou sayst.

25: Vilus took a powerful book from the Library and failed to return it.  It is named "On the Properties of Runestones."  Return it to me and I shall teach thee to use thy magical abilities to their fullest.

5: It was horrible!  The demon is more powerful than thou canst imagine.  I do not think he can be defeated by any mortal.
6: Thou speakst as if it were real, not just in a dream.
7: How didst thou come to have this dream?
8: This was no ordinary dream, but one dreamt after burning incense.   Incense causes one to have vivid dreams, and they are always true in some way.\n Simply pass a block of incense over a torch to produce the smoke which, when inhaled, will cause one to dream.\n If my dream was of a demon, then some demon truly is threatening us.
9: I hope for our sake thou art wrong.
10: Is there nothing that can be done?
11: According to my dream, the demon is too powerful to be killed by any mortal. It would have to forced into leaving this world by some other means. I hope it can be done!
12: If I meet a demon, I will keep thy advice in mind.
13: Thank thee for thy time.
14: Ah, 'tis thee again.
15: Thou dost seem more relaxed than the first time we met.
16: Hast thou any more information about the demon of your dream?
17: I have not used incense since the time of our meeting, so I have had no more dreams of demons.  Perhaps I am better off - that dream was truly terrifying.

1: Ah, hello there.  Art thou a mage, as I am?
2: I dabble in the mystical arts occasionally.
3: Yes, I consider myself to be a mage.
4: I prefer to solve the problems I encounter without resorting to magic.
5: Then I am sure thou wouldst be interested in my research.  I am exploring the properties of mantras and shrines.
6: What hast thou found?
7: Perhaps my research could benefit thee, although thou couldst probably not understand it.  I am exploring the properties of mantras and shrines.
8: What hast thou found?
9: It was long thought that the shrines of the Abyss served only to increase one's ability at some skill.  But I have found that this is not necessarily the case.  Apparently, some mantras exist that will produce objects, or dispense information.
10: What mantras are these?
11: Thy research sounds fascinating.
12: I have not been able to discover any specific mantras with these properties. However, it is said that there is a mantra which will direct one to a powerful object.  The mantra has been divided into three parts, which must be reassembled to produce the original word.  The tale is from long ago, so I know not its veracity.
13: Hast thou knowledge of any other mantras?
14: Thank thee for thy time.
15: Thou art quite welcome.  Good luck in thy quests!
16: Sadly, I have no further knowledge of individual mantras.  I hope that my research has been of some use to thee, however.
17: We shall see.
18: It certainly has.  I thank thee kindly.
19: Hail, fellow mage!
20: Greetings, adventurer.
21: @SS1  How may I help thee?
22: I would like to know more of mantras.
23: I thank thee, but I need thy help no longer.
24: Unfortunately, I know of no other legendary mantras other than the one of which I told thee previously - the mantra which has been divided into three parts.  Magical research is a long and arduous process, and only rarely does one discover truly interesting information.
25: I thank thee for the help.
26: It has been my pleasure.

33: That's the Sword of Justice, one of the Talismans of Virtue created by Cabirus.  Not too many finer weapons wilt thou see.
34: That is the Ring of Humility.  It has no magic powers, but still the Virtuous energy given it by Cabirus is undeniable.
35: That is the Shield of Valor, one of Cabirus' Talismans. It will protect your front side admirably, but 'twill not help thee if thou dost turn thy back on an enemy.

37: That is the Taper of Sacrifice, one of the Talismans of Virtue created by Cabirus.  Its light may not be great, but it will never fail thee.
38: Ah, that is the Cup of Wonder.  'Twas fashioned by Sir Cabirus himself, as one of his Talismans.  Beautiful, is it not?
39: The Wine of Compassion that is, one of Cabirus' Talismans. It was of a fine vintage, but perhaps it is past its prime now.
40: That is the Book of Honesty, one of the Talismans of Cabirus. It is said that the power of truth contained in the tome is such that its pages cannot be torn out.
41: That is the Standard of Honor, one of Cabirus' Talismans. It was to be a symbol of courage throughout all Britannia.

17: Who holds him prisoner?
18: I wish I could help thee, but I must solve my own problems.
19: He is in the clutches of the evil wizard who dominates this area.  My brother came to explore this place months ago and I have not heard from him since.  I believe he has run afoul of this vile and violent mage.
20: Tell me of this wizard.
21: If I find him, I shall set him free.
22: Rumor has it that he is the reason no one can cast spells on this level. Also, he uses monsters as henchmen to guard the way to his lair.  But I have figured out how to get by these guards!
23: How can one get past the guards?
24: Seeing the shape thou art in, I shall make my own plans.
25: A medallion of passage!  I had one but I lost it while in battle in the haunted mines to the southeast. Now I am too weak to recover it, and just wish to return home. But perhaps thou...
26: Say no more!  I will seek out these mines now.
27: Thou dost not wish to hear all I would tell thee?  Well, hear this, for it may prevent thee from ending up like I have.  A medallion of passage is needed to pass by the guards. It lies in the haunted mines in the southeast.  Now go, if thou art determined to brave the perils of these caves!

4: Well, watch thyself.  There are nasty spiders all around. My friend was just killed by one, some distance to the north. He had a key that would allow one to enter a place of some importance. There one might find an item that allows the owner to get through Tyball's maze.
5: What place does the key allow one to enter?
6: I thank thee.  What else canst thou tell me of the area?
7: Dost thou know why my magic powers have been drained?
8: I said, 'twas a key that allowed one to enter a secret place. There lies an item that permits one to pass through Tyball's maze. Wert thou not listening? The entrance is in the chasm of fire.
9: I will go kill the spider and get this key.
10: What else canst thou tell me of this area?
11: Dost thou know why my magic powers have been drained?
12: Wait! I have more information that may prove of use.
13: Well?
14: What information is this?
15: I need not thy help.  Farewell.
16: A mysterious Orb drains the magic from every living creature on this level.
17: And that why I cannot cast spells?
18: I thank thee for thy advice.  Farewell.
19: Indeed.  The Orb drains thy power and transfers it -- somewhere --  where it is put to some foul purpose.
20: Dost thou know who is behind this?
21: Farewell.
22: I know only that one mage, Tyball by name, seems immune to its effects.
23: The conclusion seems obvious.
24: I know this Tyball.  He is evil itself.
25: Indeed.  However, if thou dost wish to break the Orb's grasp on this area, best thou prepare thyself with means other than spells.
26: How can such a thing be accomplished?
27: Very well.  I thank thee.  Farewell.
28: All I can think is, if thou canst discover whence came the Orb, and obtain from its place of origin a fragment of its substance, thou mayst be able to destroy it with that.
29: This sounds an excellent idea!  But who knows whence it came?
30: I know not, but I think some friends of mine, who languish in prison, discovered its secret before they were captured by Tyball.  If thou canst talk to them, perhaps they can help thee.
31: Very well.  I thank thee for thy help.
32: I will go talk to them.
33: Good luck.
34: Thou art welcome.  Farewell.

36: Thou hast decided to talk to me after all?
37: Yes, what canst thou tell me of this area?
38: No, I think not.
39: I am sorry, but I have told thee all I can.  Perhaps my friends in the prisons can tell thee more of the Orb and the rocks made of the same substance.

4: I thank thee.  Perhaps I can help thee.  Thou doth seem to be in good health. Thou shouldst be able to make it over the lava.
5: What lava?
6: I dug myself an escape route from my cell, using only my belt-buckle. Unfortunately, the cell looks out on a lava-filled cavern, and I cannot make the leap.  I have a gamy leg, as thou can see.
7: Why didst thou come down here to begin with?
8: Perhaps I can carry thee.
9: I was a fool!  Rumor had it there were mysterious tombs down here, filled with fabulous treasures. I was searching for these when Tyball's lackeys got me...
10: Who is Tyball?
11: Where are these tombs?
12: I know naught but rumors. Some say those who find the tombs become permanent guests. It seems true in my case, at least.  But the treasure, the treasure is worth the risk...
13: That much treasure?
14: I thank thee.  Farewell.
15: Ah!  Tyball has not slain thee yet!  Thou art lucky!

20: Farewell, friend!  I'm a goner.  Get out while thou canst!
21: Oh, that much and more!  Why, I've heard tell of a knight who returned with a magical golden suit of armor. But alas, his mind was not the same, and one day he dove head-first into a pool of lava...\n In any event, thou must take care if thou doth enter the tombs.  First, though, use my escape route, and take care to jump over the rivers of lava.
22: What escape route?
23: Indeed.  My thanks for thy advice. Farewell.

30: I'm sorry to say I haven't any food or water.
31: That is indeed a pity.  Thou wilt die soon without provisions.
32: Indeed. Surely someone of thy wisdom can help me?
33: An unpleasant observation, from one who is himself trapped.
34: I cannot believe thou hast not heard of him!  He is the most dangerous man in these parts, a sorcerer with powers that dwarf those of ordinary magicians the way the sun dwarfs a candle.
35: He is probably the one I'm after, then.
36: Oh, that Tyball.  Do not worry about him.
37: Thou must be crazy!  This Tyball is dangerous, I tell thee. Who dost thou think captured all these poor souls?
38: Enough of that!  He is my quarry.  What else canst thou tell me?
39: As thou sayst.  In any event, I must be going.  How can I leave?
40: I am confident I can defeat him.  Now I must be off.
41: Nay, it is impossible!  I am done for in any event.  Get out there and save thyself!
42: Very well.  I shall return for thee if I can.
43: As thou wish.  Good luck.
44: Where is the food thou didst promise?
45: I'm sorry, here it is.
46: I haven't any food.

43: I swear by all the virtues that Tyball and I are foes!
44: Very well.  Know then, that if ye be forsworn, all that ye hast sworn upon will turn against ye!
45: I have no fear. I stand by my oath.
46: I hereby recant and void my oath.
47: Here.  Take ye this splinter of crystal.
48: Ye seem heavily laden, so I'll leave it here for ye.
49: What is it?
50: I found it three days ago while at my labors in the mines. At night it makes a faint, eerie keening. I've heard rumors of others who've found its like, and before long they're off searching for the tombs from which it came.
51: Why give it to me?
52: I don't want it.
53: It will do thee no harm, and may even help thee.  I believe  it may give thee access to the tombs.
54: I told thee I don't want it.
55: Why should I enter the tombs?
56: I believe the tombs to be of my ancient ancestors, built here long before the colony of the Abyss was formed. I've dreamt of them since finding the crystal.
57: Again, why give this crystal to me?
58: And what lies in the tombs?
59: The way I figure it, the tombs have been defiled by an evil presence. This entity places the crystal where it'll be found, in order  to draw unwary souls to its lair. I ask ye - find these tombs and cleanse them of this evil, so that others do not fall into this trap.
60: And why should I do this?
61: I will do what I can.
62: If ye can do this, I'm sure the beast responsible will have collected a sizable hoard from his victims. Ye may find the items useful in your quest against Tyball. But beware - disturb not the tombs  themselves. Search for the entrance to the south of these prisons, where the pit trap spiders prowl.  Carry the crystal with ye in your search - it may prove to be helpful.
63: Thank thee, I will see if thy suppositions prove to be true.
64: I think imprisonment has addled thy brain. However, I will take the crystal just in case...
65: I make thee this offer.

We are here.\n Hmm, this map didn't come out very well.  Oh well, take this picture anyways. It has an inscription that says "Tom."
18: I thank thee.
19: Surely this will come in handy.
20: Begone! I cannot talk.
21: Run along, before the guards come back!
22: Farewell, friend!  I'm bound for a better place!
23: Hello there!  How can I help thee?
24: I'll take any help thou canst offer.
25: Canst thou help me against the demon I seek to defeat?
26: Thou art most welcome.  May the powers of good be with thee.
27: And also with thee.  Farewell.
28: Good-bye.
29: Very well.  Don't say I didn't try to help thee.
30: I won't.

4: I was captured while on a quest for the Key of Courage.
5: I also seek the Key.
6: That is too bad.  Didst thou achieve any success?
7: Indeed?  Then know this: I believe the entrance lies directly north of this very spot.
8: What else knowest thou of this entrance?
9: A locked door blocks the way. But I still have the key hidden here in my cell.  The key to the Key, as it were.
10: May I have this key?
11: Yes, for I have been imprisoned too long and have neither heart nor strength left for this quest.
12: It is thine.
13: I thank thee.
14: I am too weary to talk.
15: Go on, do what thou must.
16: Farewell, friend!  I shall leave here as soon as I rest a bit.
17: Nay, for even as I discovered the location of my objective, I was captured by Tyball.  He seemed to think I had been speaking with his deceased brother, ridiculous as that sounds.  He would not release me.  A pity, since I believed that the recovery of the three keys would help right the wrongs of this place.
18: If thou wilt entrust me with thy knowledge, I shall take up thy quest.
19: I shall set thee free and thou canst continue thy quest.
20: No, I cannot!  I am too weak now.  Would that thou could continue my quest for me!
21: I would be glad to.
22: Perhaps.
23: Of course!  I have not seen thee in the ranks of his lackeys.  How may I help thee?
24: Well, tell me what it is that hast brought thee here.
25: How may I help thee?
26: Nay, thou canst not help me!  My freedom is not restored by unlocking these bars, for I am in ill health and can no longer follow my quest: to find the Key of Courage.
27: Truly, then, I shall undertake to complete thy quest for thee.
28: Oh, well, never mind, then.
29: Please, thou must undertake to complete my quest.  Seek thou the Key of Courage.

2: Who art thou?

4: I am Gurstang. I ventured down here searching for the Key of Truth.
5: Gurstang? I met thy colleague Illomo. He is worried about thee.
6: I, too, seek the Key.
7: Illomo! So, Illomo told thee about me. Good, that means I  can trust thee. I think I've discovered the whereabouts of the key. Tell Illomo 'Folanae.' He'll know where to look, and explain what to do. As for myself, I have other matters to attend to down here. Farewell.
8: A noble quest, indeed, and one that should be fulfilled, even though I am no longer the man to do it.  Hmm.  I shall have to take a risk and trust thee. Seek out a man in the area of the Seers of the Moonstone.  His name is Illomo.  When thou dost meet him, tell him I recommend thee to him, and say this word: "Folanae." He will know what to do next.

3: Of course.  But it may take a little while.
4: Ah, then, a prisoner like the rest of us...
5: Why art thou being held prisoner?
6: Only for the nonce.
7: Tyball keeps us here. To work the mines 'til we die... if we're lucky that is. Less fortunate ones he takes away to work his evil magicks on.
8: What dost thou mean by "evil magicks"?
9: I shall have to attend to this Tyball.
10: There are caverns to the east, filled with the dead. Victims of his  dark arts, gone awry. 'Tis said not even he dares venture there now.  But the dead things wait, taking their vengeance on any living thing  that enters.
11: Hmmm. Thou didst mention being forced to work the mines. Why?
12: Dost thou know what he attempts with his arts?
13: Who knows what we dig for? Mayhap materials he needs for his magic.  But it's been days now since I've worked the mines, after what we found on the lower level... And so few of us remain, left to rot in our cells.
14: The mines are below this level?
15: What heppened there?
16: We dug through to the level below this and hit a natural cavern. The walls were veined  with gold, but that's not what we were digging for, I'm sure. It was  here the fell beasts attacked us and killed most of us prisoners.\n The remaining few of us have been left here for days, with no food or  water. If thou couldst spare a morsel...
17: Certainly.  Eat thy fill.
18: Thank thee for thy help.
19: Oh, a hero, eh?  Ruddy great!  Won't Tyball have a time with thee!
20: What has this Tyball been doing?

30: Here is some.
31: I'm afraid not.

I have had almost no food, as the creatures I have killed are too foul to eat.
21: The way home is open for thee now. Leave now!
22: Here is some food. Wilt thou tell me more of thy exploring?
23: Here is the key. If thou'rt smarter than brave, thou wilt not use it, but wilt make thy escape with me.
24: I will leave it for you here.
25: I must finish my quest. But why dost thou stay here?
26: I may or may not find use for it. Thank thee, I must make haste.
27: The only way I have seen is across the lava, and if thou dost not burn from the heat, there are fearsome creatures of fire dwelling there!
28: I may be able to cross nonetheless. Canst thou tell me anything more?
29: I shall cross regardless. Thank thee for thy help.
30: Hah! I have faced worse threats than thee in these depths. Prepare thyself!
31: I apologize for my harshness. Please tell me about thy journey.
32: Die then, foolish one!
33: I am sorry. I will leave thee in peace.
34: I know no such person. I know only that I am trapped here by a wizard.
35: How didst thou come to be trapped?
36: Then I will take my leave before I am trapped as well.
37: Fear not, the wizard is dead. I will leave thee to make thy escape.
38: Thou art toying with me most cruelly! Leave me!
39: But thou art empty-handed! Dost thou truly wish to give me some food?
40: Yes, I'm sorry, here it is...
41: No, I have no food to give thee.
42: I thank thee kindly.  May thy quest come to a happier end than mine!
43: I thank thee most kindly. Here, I found this wand with some bones far to the southwest of here.  I believe that the bones were those of a great wizard. They were near a Knight's remains. There was more, but I had to flee a fearsome stone creature before I could gather it up.
44: Thank thee.  I will be on my way now.
45: Well, leave me then, as I must rest before I make another attempt at escape.
46: Goodbye, then.
47: Hello again.
48: Canst thou tell me about thyself?
49: Canst thou tell me where the key to the door to the demon is?
50: I have some food for thee.
51: It is good to see thee again, but farewell for now.

1: So, another comrade is caught by the Abyss!  What was thy crime, pray-tell?
2: I committed no crime.
3: I have always lived here as a peaceful fisherman.
4: I am accused of kidnapping a girl.
5: Hm, perhaps the same girl that I hear was carried through these upper caves by a Troll.
6: Yes, that must be the one!
7: Perhaps it was another.
8: Where did he take her?
9: Well, whoever she was, she's here no longer.  I don't know how far the Troll was planning on taking her, but given the strength of a Troll, he'll not likely run out of energy any time soon.
10: I must be off immediately!
11: Then there is no hope of rescuing her.
12: Hold on just a minute.  Surely that girl is in trouble, but if thou dost learn the ways of the Abyss first, thou wilt surely have a better chance of rescuing her.
13: And what should I know of the Abyss?
14: Just tell me what areas I should stay clear of.
15: Well, thou shouldst know that most of the inhabitants of the Abyss are unfriendly.  It's not so much a question of what areas to avoid as of which areas are relatively safe.\n Look for the Banner of Cabirus -- a tapestry with an ankh, such as we have -- as a sign of civilization.  Any people or creatures thou dost find past the Banner are more likely to talk with thee than eat thee.\n Speaking of ankhs, thou wouldst do well to search out the other thing they represent: the shrines.
16: What use do they serve?
17: Where can I find them?
18: When thou dost see a large, plain ankh standing on the ground, thou hast found a shrine to Virtue.\n It is said that if thou hast been virtuous, and dedicated to increasing thy abilities, praying at a shrine with the correct mantra will allow thee to enhance thy abilities.\n It is said that there is one in the southeast area of these upper caves, but I have not seen it myself.
19: I thank thee for thy information.
20: Now I must be off to use the advice thou hast given me.
21: Well, good luck in thy travels.  Thou art always welcome here.
22: Oh, thou art an innocent passerby, eh?  Perhaps thou art here on a tour of the Abyss?  Or art thou a census taker? A tax collector?  Eh?
23: I was thrown here wrongfully, and seek freedom.
24: Yes, I am simply touring these caves.
25: I was commissioned by Baron Almric to map the Abyss.
26: Already been driven mad, I see.  'Tis a pity, truly, to see the mind go on one so young.  Ah, well, death is probably thy best hope. Good luck.
27: Thrown here against thy will I will believe, but wrongfully is a different matter.  No need to pretend amoungst us, though.  Not a one of us believes in Almric's petty justice.\n  Now that thou'rt here, thou shouldst stay with us.  The creatures beyond are far worse than anything Almric could do to thee.  Right here near the door is safest.  Trust me.
28: What is out there that is so bad?
29: Dost thou ever venture outside?
30: 'Tis unbelievable. Once, it is said, all the races here lived in harmony.  Not now, that's for certain.  The Gobs on this level are constantly at war, with each other as well as everyone else.  And below are things I dare not speak of.\n 'Tis rumored that some remnants of civilization remain in most colonized areas of the Abyss, but I have never had the courage or interest to find out.
31: How can I find whatever civilization remains?
32: Dost thou have any advice for survival?
33: A hearty welcome to thee.  Hast thou decided to stay with us?
34: No, my destiny lies elsewhere.
35: Perhaps for a while.
36: I am glad to hear it.  This is by far the safest place in the Abyss.
37: I think not, but I would like any advice thou canst give me.

1: A human it is.  We have been watching you.  A fine race you are, but somewhat unknowledgable.  To divide all your intelligence amongst yourselves as you do - it does not seem correct.  And your bodies must be so hard to maintain.  Still, we are impressed that you do as well as you do.
2: Do you not miss having bodies?
3: Is it not equally difficult to consist only of globes of light?
4: Surely it is not so.  Having no bodies to hamper us, we have no worries or cares.  We can devote our whole being to our sole quest - the gathering of information.
5: And what information have you gathered?
6: I must know very little compared to you.
7: Indeed, most of the things we know are on such a high plane that it is doubtful a human would be able to understand them.
8: I doubt it.
9: Such as what?
10: Ah, so you would know information so advanced it is more dangerous than you can imagine?  Very well, here is a piece for you: the spell Vas Kal Corp will bring an end to life as you know it, although higher beings such as we will continue to exist in our own way.  There.  We are eager to see to what use you will put this information.
11: Thank thee.  I will try it out.
12: Perhaps you are not as intelligent as we first thought.
13: This information is useless to me.
14: And that itself is something it is good you should know.
15: So you have decided not to use the information we have given you?
16: Yes.  It is too dangerous.
17: If you have learned that not all information is beneficial, you have indeed learned some beneficial information.
18: I will shortly.
19: Indeed!  That will be an interesting sight.
